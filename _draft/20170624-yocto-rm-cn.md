### 1.3.1. 支持的 Linux 发行版 [¶][402]

Currently, the Yocto Project is supported on the following distributions:

### 笔记

Yocto Project releases are tested against the stable Linux distributions in the following list. The Yocto Project should work on other distributions but validation is not performed against them.

In particular, the Yocto Project does not support and currently has no plans to support rolling-releases or development distributions due to their constantly changing nature. We welcome patches and bug reports, but keep in mind that our priority is on the supported platforms listed below.

If you encounter problems, please go to [Yocto Project Bugzilla][3434] and submit a bug. We are interested in hearing about your experience.

*   Ubuntu 14.04 (LTS)

*   Ubuntu 14.10

*   Ubuntu 15.04

*   Ubuntu 15.10

*   Ubuntu 16.04

*   Fedora release 22

*   Fedora release 23

*   Fedora release 24

*   CentOS release 7.x

*   Debian GNU/Linux 8.x (Jessie)

*   openSUSE 13.2

*   openSUSE 42.1

### 笔记

While the Yocto Project Team attempts to ensure all Yocto Project releases are one hundred percent compatible with each officially supported Linux distribution, instances might exist where you encounter a problem while using the Yocto Project on a specific distribution.

### 1.3.2. 主机开发环境需要的包[¶][403]

The list of packages you need on the host development system can be large when covering all build scenarios using the Yocto Project. This section provides required packages according to Linux distribution and function.

#### 1.3.2.1. Ubuntu 和 Debian[¶][16]

The following list shows the required packages by function given a supported Ubuntu or Debian Linux distribution:

### Note

If your build system has the `oss4-dev` package installed, you might experience QEMU build failures due to the package installing its own custom `/usr/include/linux/soundcard.h` on the Debian system. If you run into this situation, either of the following solutions exist:
```
     $ sudo apt-get build-dep qemu
     $ sudo apt-get remove oss4-dev

```

*   _Essentials:_  Packages needed to build an image on a headless system:

#### 1.3.2.4. CentOS Packages[¶][19]

The following list shows the required packages by function given a supported CentOS Linux distribution:

### Note

For CentOS 6.x, some of the versions of the components provided by the distribution are too old (e.g. Git, Python, and tar). It is recommended that you install the buildtools in order to provide versions that will work with the OpenEmbedded build system. For information on how to install the buildtools tarball, see the "[Required Git, Tar, and Python Versions][3435]" section.

*   _Essentials:_  Packages needed to build an image for a headless system:

    ```

         diffutils diffstat git cpp gcc gcc-c++ glibc-devel texinfo chrpath socat \
         perl-Data-Dumper perl-Text-ParseWords perl-Thread-Queue python34-pip xz \
         which SDL-devel xterm

    ```

    ### Notes

    *   Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux (i.e. `epel-release`) is a collection of packages from Fedora built on RHEL/CentOS for easy installation of packages not included in enterprise Linux by default. You need to install these packages separately.

    *   The `makecache` command consumes additional Metadata from `epel-release`.

*   _Graphical and Eclipse Plug-In Extras:_  Packages recommended if the host system has graphics support or if you are going to use the Eclipse IDE:

    ```
         $ sudo yum install SDL-devel xterm

    ```

*   _Documentation:_  Packages needed if you are going to build out the Yocto Project documentation manuals:

    ```
         $ sudo yum install make docbook-style-dsssl docbook-style-xsl \
         docbook-dtds docbook-utils fop libxslt dblatex xmlto xsltproc

    ```

*   _OpenEmbedded Self-Test (`oe-selftest`):_  Packages needed if you are going to run `oe-selftest`:

    ```
         $ sudo yum install GitPython

    ```

### 1.3.3.要求的 Git, tar, and Python 版本[¶][404]

In order to use the build system, your host development system must meet the following version requirements for Git, tar, and Python:

*   Git 1.8.3.1 or greater

*   tar 1.24 or greater

*   Python 3.4.0 or greater

If your host development system does not meet all these requirements, you can resolve this by installing a `buildtools` tarball that contains these tools. You can get the tarball one of two ways: download a pre-built tarball or use BitBake to build the tarball.

#### 1.3.3.1. 下载构件好的 `buildtools` 压缩包[¶][20]

Downloading and running a pre-built buildtools installer is the easiest of the two methods by which you can get these tools:

1.  Locate and download the `*.sh` at [http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/yocto/yocto-2.3/buildtools/][405].

2.  Execute the installation script. Here is an example:

    ```
         $ sh poky-glibc-x86_64-buildtools-tarball-x86_64-buildtools-nativesdk-standalone-2.3.sh

    ```

    During execution, a prompt appears that allows you to choose the installation directory. For example, you could choose the following:

    ```
         /home/your-username/buildtools

    ```

3.  Source the tools environment setup script by using a command like the following:

    ```
         $ source /home/your_username/buildtools/environment-setup-i586-poky-linux

    ```

    Of course, you need to supply your installation directory and be sure to use the right file (i.e. i585 or x86-64).

    After you have sourced the setup script, the tools are added to `PATH` and any other environment variables required to run the tools are initialized. The results are working versions versions of Git, tar, Python and `chrpath`.

#### 1.3.3.2. 构建自己的 `buildtools`软件包[¶][21]

Building and running your own buildtools installer applies only when you have a build host that can already run BitBake. In this case, you use that machine to build the `.sh` file and then take steps to transfer and run it on a machine that does not meet the minimal Git, tar, and Python requirements.

Here are the steps to take to build and run your own buildtools installer:

1.  On the machine that is able to run BitBake, be sure you have set up your build environment with the setup script ([`oe-init-build-env`][406] or [`oe-init-build-env-memres`][407]).

2.  Run the BitBake command to build the tarball:

    ```
         $ bitbake buildtools-tarball

    ```

    ### Note

    The [`SDKMACHINE`][408] variable in your `local.conf` file determines whether you build tools for a 32-bit or 64-bit system.

    Once the build completes, you can find the `.sh` file that installs the tools in the `tmp/deploy/sdk` subdirectory of the [Build Directory][409]. The installer file has the string "buildtools" in the name.

3.  Transfer the `.sh` file from the build host to the machine that does not meet the Git, tar, or Python requirements.

4.  On the machine that does not meet the requirements, run the `.sh` file to install the tools. Here is an example:

    ```
         $ sh poky-glibc-x86_64-buildtools-tarball-x86_64-buildtools-nativesdk-standalone-2.3.sh

    ```

    During execution, a prompt appears that allows you to choose the installation directory. For example, you could choose the following:

    ```
         /home/your_username/buildtools

    ```

5.  Source the tools environment setup script by using a command like the following:

    ```
         $ source /home/your_username/buildtools/environment-setup-i586-poky-linux

    ```

    Of course, you need to supply your installation directory and be sure to use the right file (i.e. i585 or x86-64).

    After you have sourced the setup script, the tools are added to `PATH` and any other environment variables required to run the tools are initialized. The results are working versions versions of Git, tar, Python and `chrpath`.

### 1.4. 获取 Yocto Project[¶][765]

The Yocto Project development team makes the Yocto Project available through a number of methods:

*   _Source Repositories:_  Working from a copy of the upstream `poky` repository is the preferred method for obtaining and using a Yocto Project release. You can view the Yocto Project Source Repositories at [http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit.cgi][1810]. In particular, you can find the `poky` repository at[http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/poky/][1811].

*   _Releases:_  Stable, tested releases are available as tarballs through [http://downloads.yoctoproject.org/releases/yocto/][1812].

*   _Nightly Builds:_  These tarball releases are available at [http://autobuilder.yoctoproject.org/pub/nightly/][1813]. These builds include Yocto Project releases, SDK installation scripts, and experimental builds.

*   _Yocto Project Website:_  You can find tarball releases of the Yocto Project and supported BSPs at the [Yocto Project website][1814]. Along with these downloads, you can find lots of other information at this site.

### 1.5. Development Checkouts[¶][766]

Development using the Yocto Project requires a local [Source Directory][4165]. You can set up the Source Directory by cloning a copy of the upstream [poky][4166] Git repository. For information on how to do this, see the "[Getting Set Up][4167]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

### Chapter 2. 使用 Yocto 项目[¶][1815]

This chapter describes common usage for the Yocto Project. The information is introductory in nature as other manuals in the Yocto Project documentation set provide more details on how to use the Yocto Project.

### 2.1. 运行构建[¶][782]

This section provides a summary of the build process and provides information for less obvious aspects of the build process. For general information on how to build an image using the OpenEmbedded build system, see the "[Building Images][4168]" section of the Yocto Project Quick Start.

### 2.1.1. 构建全览[¶][410]

In the development environment you will need to build an image whenever you change hardware support, add or change system libraries, or add or change services that have dependencies.
在开发环境中你将需要

![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/building-an-image.png)

Building an Image

The first thing you need to do is set up the OpenEmbedded build environment by sourcing an environment setup script (i.e. [`oe-init-build-env`][3743] or [`oe-init-build-env-memres`][3744]). Here is an example:

```
     $ source oe-init-build-env [build_dir]

```

The  _`build_dir`_  argument is optional and specifies the directory the OpenEmbedded build system uses for the build - the [Build Directory][3745]. If you do not specify a Build Directory, it defaults to a directory named `build` in your current working directory. A common practice is to use a different Build Directory for different targets. For example, `~/build/x86` for a `qemux86` target, and `~/build/arm` for a `qemuarm` target.

Once the build environment is set up, you can build a target using:

```
     $ bitbake target

```

### Note

If you experience a build error due to resources temporarily being unavailable and it appears you should not be having this issue, it might be due to the combination of a 4.3+ Linux kernel and `systemd` version 228+ (i.e. see this [link][3441] for information).

To work around this issue, you can try either of the following:

*   Try the build again.

*   Modify the "DefaultTasksMax" `systemd` parameter by uncommenting it and setting it to "infinity". You can find this parameter in the `system.conf` file located in `/etc/systemd` on most systems.

The  _`target`_  is the name of the recipe you want to build. Common targets are the images in `meta/recipes-core/images`, `meta/recipes-sato/images`, etc. all found in the [Source Directory][3746]. Or, the target can be the name of a recipe for a specific piece of software such as BusyBox. For more details about the images the OpenEmbedded build system supports, see the "[Images][3747]" chapter.

### Note

Building an image without GNU General Public License Version 3 (GPLv3), or similarly licensed, components is supported for only minimal and base images. See the "[Images][3748]" chapter for more information.

### 2.1.2. Building an Image Using GPL Components[¶][411]

When building an image using GPL components, you need to maintain your original settings and not switch back and forth applying different versions of the GNU General Public License. If you rebuild using different versions of GPL, dependency errors might occur due to some components not being rebuilt.

### 2.2. Installing and Using the Result[¶][783]

Once an image has been built, it often needs to be installed. The images and kernels built by the OpenEmbedded build system are placed in the [Build Directory][4169] in `tmp/deploy/images`. For information on how to run pre-built images such as `qemux86` and `qemuarm`, see the [Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK) Developer's Guide][4170]. For information about how to install these images, see the documentation for your particular board or machine.

### 2.3. Debugging Tools and Techniques[¶][784]

The exact method for debugging build failures depends on the nature of the problem and on the system's area from which the bug originates. Standard debugging practices such as comparison against the last known working version with examination of the changes and the re-application of steps to identify the one causing the problem are valid for the Yocto Project just as they are for any other system. Even though it is impossible to detail every possible potential failure, this section provides some general tips to aid in debugging.

A useful feature for debugging is the error reporting tool. Configuring the Yocto Project to use this tool causes the OpenEmbedded build system to produce error reporting commands as part of the console output. You can enter the commands after the build completes to log error information into a common database, that can help you figure out what might be going wrong. For information on how to enable and use this feature, see the "[Using the Error Reporting Tool][4171]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

For discussions on debugging, see the "[Debugging With the GNU Project Debugger (GDB) Remotely][4172]" section in the Yocto Project Developer's Manual and the "[Working within Eclipse][4173]" section in the Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK) Developer's Guide.

### Note

The remainder of this section presents many examples of the `bitbake` command. You can learn about BitBake by reading the [BitBake User Manual][4174].

### 2.3.1. Viewing Logs from Failed Tasks[¶][412]

You can find the log for a task in the file `${`[`WORKDIR`][3749]`}/temp/log.do_` _`taskname`_ . For example, the log for the [`do_compile`][3750] task of the QEMU minimal image for the x86 machine (`qemux86`) might be in `tmp/work/qemux86-poky-linux/core-image-minimal/1.0-r0/temp/log.do_compile`. To see the commands [BitBake][3751] ran to generate a log, look at the corresponding `run.do_` _`taskname`_  file in the same directory.

`log.do_` _`taskname`_  and `run.do_` _`taskname`_  are actually symbolic links to `log.do_` _`taskname`_ `.` _`pid`_  and `log.run_` _`taskname`_ `.` _`pid`_ , where  _`pid`_  is the PID the task had when it ran. The symlinks always point to the files corresponding to the most recent run.

### 2.3.2. Viewing Variable Values[¶][413]

BitBake's `-e` option is used to display variable values after parsing. The following command displays the variable values after the configuration files (i.e. `local.conf`, `bblayers.conf`, `bitbake.conf` and so forth) have been parsed:

```
     $ bitbake -e

```

The following command displays variable values after a specific recipe has been parsed. The variables include those from the configuration as well:

```
     $ bitbake -e recipename

```

### Note

Each recipe has its own private set of variables (datastore). Internally, after parsing the configuration, a copy of the resulting datastore is made prior to parsing each recipe. This copying implies that variables set in one recipe will not be visible to other recipes.

Likewise, each task within a recipe gets a private datastore based on the recipe datastore, which means that variables set within one task will not be visible to other tasks.

In the output of `bitbake -e`, each variable is preceded by a description of how the variable got its value, including temporary values that were later overriden. This description also includes variable flags (varflags) set on the variable. The output can be very helpful during debugging.

Variables that are exported to the environment are preceded by `export` in the output of `bitbake -e`. See the following example:

```
     export CC="i586-poky-linux-gcc -m32 -march=i586 --sysroot=/home/ulf/poky/build/tmp/sysroots/qemux86"

```

In addition to variable values, the output of the `bitbake -e` and `bitbake -e`  _`recipe`_  commands includes the following information:

*   The output starts with a tree listing all configuration files and classes included globally, recursively listing the files they include or inherit in turn. Much of the behavior of the OpenEmbedded build system (including the behavior of the [normal recipe build tasks][785]) is implemented in the [`base`][786] class and the classes it inherits, rather than being built into BitBake itself.

*   After the variable values, all functions appear in the output. For shell functions, variables referenced within the function body are expanded. If a function has been modified using overrides or using override-style operators like `_append` and `_prepend`, then the final assembled function body appears in the output.

### 2.3.3. Viewing Package Information with `oe-pkgdata-util`[¶][414]

You can use the `oe-pkgdata-util` command-line utility to query [`PKGDATA_DIR`][3752] and display various package-related information. When you use the utility, you must use it to view information on packages that have already been built.

你可以使用 `oe-pkgdata-util` 命令行工具查询 [`PKGDATA_DIR`][3752] 并显示各种和软件包相关的信息。当你使用这个工具，你必须使用它查看已经构件号的软件包的信息。

Following are a few of the available `oe-pkgdata-util` subcommands.

下面是 `oe-pkgdata-util` 几个可用的子命令

### Note

You can use the standard * and ? globbing wildcards as part of package names and paths.
你可以使用标准的 * 和 ？ 通配符作为包名称和路径的一部分

*   `oe-pkgdata-util list-pkgs [` _`pattern`_ `]`: Lists all packages that have been built, optionally limiting the match to packages that match  _`pattern`_ .
*   `oe-pkgdata-util list-pkg  [` _`pattern`_ `]`： 列出所有已经构建好的软件包，可以限制匹配 _`pattern`_ 模式。

*   `oe-pkgdata-util list-pkg-files ` _`package`_ ` ...`: Lists the files and directories contained in the given packages.
*   `oe-pkgdata-util list-pkg-files ` _`package`_ ` ...`：练出软件包包含的文件和目录。

    ### Note

    A different way to view the contents of a package is to look at the `${`[`WORKDIR`][415]`}/packages-split` directory of the recipe that generates the package. This directory is created by the [`do_package`][416] task and has one subdirectory for each package the recipe generates, which contains the files stored in that package.
    另一个不同的查看软件包内容的方法是直接检查 `${`[`WORKDIR`][415]`}/packages-split` 目录，这里面都是生成软件包的配方脚本。这个目录是 [`do_package`][416] 任务穿件的，并且由这个脚本生成的每个软件包都有一个对应的子目录，保存的是软件包内的文件。

    If you want to inspect the `${WORKDIR}/packages-split` directory, make sure that [`rm_work`][417] is not enabled when you build the recipe.

    如果你想检查目录  `${WORKDIR}/packages-split` ，请确定在你构建时 [`rm_work`][417] 是关闭的。

*   `oe-pkgdata-util find-path ` _`path`_ ` ...`: Lists the names of the packages that contain the given paths. For example, the following tells us that`/usr/share/man/man1/make.1` is contained in the `make-doc` package:
*    `oe-pkgdata-util find-path ` _`path`_ ` ...`： 列出包含给定路径的软件包。举个例子，下面信息告诉我们 `man-doc` 包含了 `/usr/share/man/man1/make.1`。


    ```
         $ oe-pkgdata-util find-path /usr/share/man/man1/make.1
         make-doc: /usr/share/man/man1/make.1

    ```

*   `oe-pkgdata-util lookup-recipe ` _`package`_ ` ...`: Lists the name of the recipes that produce the given packages.
*   `oe-pkgdata-util lookup-recipe ` _`package`_ ` ...`： 列出生成指定软件包的脚本名。

For more information on the `oe-pkgdata-util` command, use the help facility:
关于命令 `oe-pkgdata-util` 的更多信息可以使用 help 组件获取：

```
     $ oe-pkgdata-util ‐‐help
     $ oe-pkgdata-util subcommand --help

```

### 2.3.4. 查看任务和脚本之间的依赖关系[¶][418]

Sometimes it can be hard to see why BitBake wants to build other recipes before the one you have specified. Dependency information can help you understand why a recipe is built.
有时候很难判断 BitBake 为什么要在构建你的指定的软件包之前还要构建其他recipe。依赖信息可以帮助你立即为什么要构建某个recipe。

To generate dependency information for a recipe, run the following command:
要生成某个脚本的依赖信息，可以运行下面的命令：

```
     $ bitbake -g recipename

```

This command writes the following files in the current directory:
这条命令会在当前目录生成下面的文件：

*   `pn-buildlist`: A list of recipes/targets involved in building  _`recipename`_ . "Involved" here means that at least one task from the recipe needs to run when building  _`recipename`_  from scratch. Targets that are in [`ASSUME_PROVIDED`][787] are not listed.
*   `pn-buildlist`： 涉及到构建 _`recipename`_ 的 recipes/targets 的列表。“涉及” 在此处的意思是构建 _`recipename`_ 过程中，recipe 的至少一个 task 需要运行。在  [`ASSUME_PROVIDED`][787] 中的 targets 不会列出来。

*   `task-depends.dot`: A graph showing dependencies between tasks.
*   `task-depends.dot`： 图形化显示 task 之间的依赖关系。

The graphs are in [DOT][3753] format and can be converted to images (e.g. using the `dot` tool from [Graphviz][3754]).
图像是 [DOT][3753] 格式，可以转换成图片 (比如， 使用 [Graphviz][3754] 的 `dot` 工具).

### Notes

*   DOT files use a plain text format. The graphs generated using the `bitbake -g` command are often so large as to be difficult to read without special pruning (e.g. with Bitbake's `-I` option) and processing. Despite the form and size of the graphs, the corresponding `.dot` files can still be possible to read and provide useful information.
*   DOT 文件是纯文本格式。使用 `bitbake -g` 生成的图像通常都很大，如果不做特殊裁剪（比如，配合 BitBake 的 `-I` 选项）会很难阅读和处理。尽管图像的格式和大小，对应的 `.dot` 文件仍然可以阅读并提供有用的信息。

    As an example, the `task-depends.dot` file contains lines such as the following:
    作为一个例子，文件 `task-depends.dot` 包含了下面的内容：


    ```
         "libxslt.do_configure" -> "libxml2.do_populate_sysroot"

    ```

    The above example line reveals that the [`do_configure`][419] task in `libxslt` depends on the [`do_populate_sysroot`][420] task in `libxml2`, which is a normal [`DEPENDS`][421] dependency between the two recipes.
    上面的例子反应了在 `libxslt` 中的 [`do_configure`][419] task 依赖于 `libxml2` 中的 [`do_populate_sysroot`][420] task，这是两个 recipe 之间通常的依赖。

*   For an example of how `.dot` files can be processed, see the `scripts/contrib/graph-tool` Python script, which finds and displays paths between graph nodes.
*   举个如何处理 `.dot` 的例子，可以查看 `scripts/contrib/graph-tool` 中的 Python 脚本，它可以查找和显示两个图像节点间的路径。

You can use a different method to view dependency information by using the following command:
通过使用下面的命令，你可以使用一个不同的方法来查看依赖信息：

```
     $ bitbake -g -u taskexp recipename

```

This command displays a GUI window from which you can view build-time and runtime dependencies for the recipes involved in building  _`recipename`_ .
这个命令会显示一个图形界面窗口，在上面你可以查看构建 _`recipename`_ 的构建时间和运行时依赖关系。

### 2.3.5. 查看任务变量依赖关系[¶][422]

As mentioned in the "[Checksums (Signatures)][3755]" section of the BitBake User Manual, BitBake tries to automatically determine what variables a task depends on so that it can rerun the task if any values of the variables change. This determination is usually reliable. However, if you do things like construct variable names at runtime, then you might have to manually declare dependencies on those variables using `vardeps` as described in the "[Variable Flags][3756]" section of the BitBake User Manual.
如在 BitBake User Manual的 "[Checksums (Signatures)][3755]" 一节提到的，BitBake 会尝试自动化决定 task 依赖那些变量，这样如果任何一个变量的值变了，它就可以重新运行这个任务。这个决策通常是可靠的。然而如果你做一些运行中构造变量名的操作，那么你就可能必须使用 `vardeps` 手动声明变量间的依赖关系，用法在 BitBake User Manual 中的 "[Variable Flags][3756]" 一节有说明。

If you are unsure whether a variable dependency is being picked up automatically for a given task, you can list the variable dependencies BitBake has determined by doing the following:
如果你不确定某个变量的依赖关系在特定 task 中被使用了，你可以通过下面的操作列出 BitBake 已经使用了的变量依赖关系：

1.  Build the recipe containing the task:
1.  构建包含 task 的 recipe：

    ```
         $ bitbake recipename

    ```

2.  Inside the [`STAMPS_DIR`][788] directory, find the signature data (`sigdata`) file that corresponds to the task. The `sigdata` files contain a pickled Python database of all the metadata that went into creating the input checksum for the task. As an example, for the [`do_fetch`][789] task of the `db` recipe, the`sigdata` file might be found in the following location:
2.  在目录 [`STAMPS_DIR`][788] 中找出 task 对应的签名数据（`sigdata`）文件。`sigdata` 文件包含了一个 pickled Python 数据库，这存储了全部要用来创建 task 的输入校验和的元数据。作为一个例子，对于 `db` recipe 的 [`do_fetch`][789] task，`sigdata` 文件可以在下面的位置找到：

    ```
         ${BUILDDIR}/tmp/stamps/i586-poky-linux/db/6.0.30-r1.do_fetch.sigdata.7c048c18222b16ff0bcee2000ef648b1

    ```

    For tasks that are accelerated through the shared state ([sstate][790]) cache, an additional `siginfo` file is written into [`SSTATE_DIR`][791] along with the cached task output. The `siginfo` files contain exactly the same information as `sigdata` files.
    对于要通过共享状态([sstate][790])缓存加速的 task ，额外的 `siginfo` 文件要联通 task 输出一起写到 [`SSTATE_DIR`][791] 目录。 `siginfo` 文件包含了和 `sigdata` 文件一样的信息。

3.  Run `bitbake-dumpsig` on the `sigdata` or `siginfo` file. Here is an example:
3.  对文件 `sigdata` 或 `siginfo` 运行 `bitbake-dumpsig`命令。下面和四个例子：

    ```
         $ bitbake-dumpsig ${BUILDDIR}/tmp/stamps/i586-poky-linux/db/6.0.30-r1.do_fetch.sigdata.7c048c18222b16ff0bcee2000ef648b1

    ```

    In the output of the above command, you will find a line like the following, which lists all the (inferred) variable dependencies for the task. This list also includes indirect dependencies from variables depending on other variables, recursively.
    上面命令的输出中，你将会找到一行类似下面的内容，这列出了这个 task 的全部（推测的）变量依赖关系。这个列表同时也递归的包括了变量之间的间接依赖关系

    ```
         Task dependencies: ['PV', 'SRCREV', 'SRC_URI', 'SRC_URI[md5sum]', 'SRC_URI[sha256sum]', 'base_do_fetch']

    ```

    ### Note

    Functions (e.g. `base_do_fetch`) also count as variable dependencies. These functions in turn depend on the variables they reference.
    函数（比如 `base_do_fetch`）也会被当做变量的依赖。这些函数按顺序依赖于它们引用的变量。

    The output of `bitbake-dumpsig` also includes the value each variable had, a list of dependencies for each variable, and [`BB_HASHBASE_WHITELIST`][792]information.
    `bitbake-dumpsig` 的输出同时也会包含每个变量的值，每个变量的依赖关系列表，以及 [`BB_HASHBASE_WHITELIST`][792] 信息。

There is also a `bitbake-diffsigs` command for comparing two `siginfo` or `sigdata` files. This command can be helpful when trying to figure out what changed between two versions of a task. If you call `bitbake-diffsigs` with just one file, the command behaves like `bitbake-dumpsig`.
有一个 `bitbake-diffsigs` 命令可以比较两个 `siginfo` 或 `sigdata` 文件。当你尝试找出一个任务的两个版本有何变化时会很有帮助。如果你调用 `bitbake-diffsigs` 处理一个文件，效果就和 `bitbake-dumpsig` 一样。

You can also use BitBake to dump out the signature construction information without executing tasks by using either of the following BitBake command-line options:
你也可以使用下面的 BitBake 命令行选项来输出签名结构信息而不执行 task。

```
     ‐‐dump-signatures=SIGNATURE_HANDLER
     -S SIGNATURE_HANDLER

```

### Note

Two common values for  _`SIGNATURE_HANDLER`_  are "none" and "printdiff", which dump only the signature or compare the dumped signature with the cached one, respectively.
_`SIGNATURE_HANDLER`_ 的两个通常值是 "none" 和 "printdiff"，这只会导出签名内容或者和缓存中已有的导出的签名内容进行比较。

Using BitBake with either of these options causes BitBake to dump out `sigdata` files in the `stamps` directory for every task it would have executed instead of building the specified target package.
使用 BitBake 和其中任意的选项可以造成 BitBake 在 `stamps` 目录导出每个它执行的而不是构建的特定目标软件包的 `sigdata` 文件。

### 2.3.6. 运行特定的 task[¶][423]

Any given recipe consists of a set of tasks. The standard BitBake behavior in most cases is: `do_fetch`, `do_unpack`, `do_patch`, `do_configure`,`do_compile`, `do_install`, `do_package`, `do_package_write_*`, and `do_build`. The default task is `do_build` and any tasks on which it depends build first. Some tasks, such as `do_devshell`, are not part of the default build chain. If you wish to run a task that is not part of the default build chain, you can use the `-c` option in BitBake. Here is an example:
任何给定的 recipe 都包含一组 task。标准的 BitBake 行为通常是： `do_fetch`，`do_unpack`，`do_patch`，`do_configure`，`do_compile`，`do_install`，`do_package`，`do_package_write_*`，和 `do_build`。默认的 task 是 `do_build` 和任何它依赖的 task。一些 task ，比如 `do_devshell` ，就不是默认构建链中的一环。如果你希望运行默认构建链以外的任务，你需要在 BitBake 中使用 `-c` 选项。下面是一个例子：

```
     $ bitbake matchbox-desktop -c devshell

```

The `-c` option respects task dependencies, which means that all other tasks (including tasks from other recipes) that the specified task depends on will be run before the task. Even when you manually specify a task to run with `-c`, BitBake will only run the task if it considers it "out of date". See the "[Stamp Files and the Rerunning of Tasks][3757]" section for how BitBake determines whether a task is "out of date".
`-c` 选项对应的 task 依赖意味着指定任务依赖的其它全部 task（包括其它 recipe 的 task）都将会在执行 task 之前运行。即使当你使用 `-c` 选项手动选择一个任务执行时， BitBake 也只会在它认为过期的情况下运行这个任务。具体参见 "[Stamp Files and the Rerunning of Tasks][3757]" 一节，了解 BitBake 如何决定一个任务过期了。

If you want to force an up-to-date task to be rerun (e.g. because you made manual modifications to the recipe's [`WORKDIR`][3758] that you want to try out), then you can use the `-f` option.
如果你想要强制一个最新的 task 重新运行（比如，因为你自己手动修改了 recipe 的 [`WORKDIR`][3758] ，想要试验一下），然后你可以使用 `-f` 选项。

### Note

The reason `-f` is never required when running the [`do_devshell`][3759] task is because the `[`[`nostamp`][3760]`]` variable flag is already set for the task.

在运行 [`do_devshell`][3759] task 时从来不需要 `-f` 选项的原因是 `[`[`nostamp`][3760]`]` 变量标志已经为任务添加了这个选项。

The following example shows one way you can use the `-f` option:
下面的例子展示了一种你可以使用 `-f` 选项的情景：

```
     $ bitbake matchbox-desktop
               .
               .
     make some changes to the source code in the work directory
               .
               .
     $ bitbake matchbox-desktop -c compile -f
     $ bitbake matchbox-desktop

```

This sequence first builds and then recompiles `matchbox-desktop`. The last command reruns all tasks (basically the packaging tasks) after the compile. BitBake recognizes that the `do_compile` task was rerun and therefore understands that the other tasks also need to be run again.
这个命令序列首先构建，然后重新编译 `matchbox-desktop`。最后一个命令在编译之后重新运行了全部 task（基础的打包 task）。 BitBake 识别出 `do_compile` task 是在重新运行，因此理解其它 task 也需要再次运行。

Another, shorter way to rerun a task and all [normal recipe build tasks][3761] that depend on it is to use the `-C` option.
另外，重新运行一个 task 和它依赖的全部 [正常 recipe 构建 tasks][3761] 的更简单的做法是使用 `-C` 选项。

### Note

This option is upper-cased and is separate from the `-c` option, which is lower-cased.
这个选项和 `-c` 的区别是前者是大写的后者是小写的。

Using this option invalidates the given task and then runs the [`do_build`][3762] task, which is the default task if no task is given, and the tasks on which it depends. You could replace the final two commands in the previous example with the following single command:
使用这个选项无效给定的任务，然后运行 [`do_build`][3762] task ，这个 task 是在没有给定 task 的情况下的默认 task， 和它依赖的 task。你可以在上面的例子中用下面的一条命令替换最后两个命令：

```
     $ bitbake matchbox-desktop -C compile

```

Internally, the `-f` and `-C` options work by tainting (modifying) the input checksum of the specified task. This tainting indirectly causes the task and its dependent tasks to be rerun through the normal task dependency mechanisms.
在内部， `-f` 和 `-C` 选项通过检查指定 task 的校验和是否被修改了来工作。这些变动会间接的造成 task 和它依赖的 task 因为正常的 task 依赖机制重新运行。

### Note

BitBake explicitly keeps track of which tasks have been tainted in this fashion, and will print warnings such as the following for builds involving such tasks:
BitBake 照这样明确的追踪那些task 被修改了，将会打印下面那样的关于涉及构建的 task 的警告信息：

```
     WARNING: /home/ulf/poky/meta/recipes-sato/matchbox-desktop/matchbox-desktop_2.1.bb.do_compile is tainted from a forced run

```
The purpose of the warning is to let you know that the work directory and build output might not be in the clean state they would be in for a "normal" build, depending on what actions you took. To get rid of such warnings, you can remove the work directory and rebuild the recipe, as follows:
警告的目的是让你知道工作目录，以及构建输出可能不是在一个干净的状态下进行的，根据你采取的动作，他们有可能需要进行一次“正常”构建。要避免下面的警告，你可以删除工作目录然后再重新构建 recipe，如下所述：

```
     $ bitbake matchbox-desktop -c clean
     $ bitbake matchbox-desktop

```

You can view a list of tasks in a given package by running the `do_listtasks` task as follows:
你可以通过运行 `do_listtasks` 任务看到给定软件包的 task 列表：

```
     $ bitbake matchbox-desktop -c listtasks

```

The results appear as output to the console and are also in the file `${WORKDIR}/temp/log.do_listtasks`.
结果会输出到中断，同时也会保存在文件 `${WORKDIR}/temp/log.do_listtasks`。

### 2.3.7. 通常 BitBake 问题[¶][424]

You can see debug output from BitBake by using the `-D` option. The debug output gives more information about what BitBake is doing and the reason behind it. Each `-D` option you use increases the logging level. The most common usage is `-DDD`.
你可以通过使用 `-D` 选项查看 BitBake 的调试输出结果。这些调试输出结果可以提供更多关于 BitBake 干了什么和为什么这么干的信息。你每增加一个 `-D` 选项，就可以提高日志等级。通常用得最多的是 `-DDD`。

The output from `bitbake -DDD -v`  _`targetname`_  can reveal why BitBake chose a certain version of a package or why BitBake picked a certain provider. This command could also help you in a situation where you think BitBake did something unexpected.
`bitbake -DDD -v` _`targetname`_ 命令的输出可以展示为什么 BitBake 挑选某个特定版本的软件包，或者为什么 BitBake 挑选某个供应者。这条命令页可以在 BitBake 干了不是你预期动作的情况帮助你。

### 2.3.8. 开发主机系统问题[¶][425]

Sometimes issues on the host development system can cause your build to fail. Following are known, host-specific problems. Be sure to always consult the [Release Notes][3763] for a look at all release-related issues.
有些时候开发主机系统的的问题可能造成你的构建失败。下面是一些已知的主机相关的问题。一定要确保查阅 [Release Notes][3763] 来了解发行版相关的问题。

*   _`glibc-initial` fails to build_ : If your development host system has the unpatched `GNU Make 3.82`, the [`do_install`][793] task fails for `glibc-initial`during the build.
*   _`glibc-initial` 构建失败_ : 如果你的开发环境没有打补丁的 `GNU Make 3.82`，那么 [`do_install`][793] task 就会因为 `glibc-initial` 在构建过程中失败。 

    Typically, every distribution that ships `GNU Make 3.82` as the default already has the patched version. However, some distributions, such as Debian, have `GNU Make 3.82` as an option, which is unpatched. You will see this error on these types of distributions. Switch to `GNU Make 3.81` or patch your `make` to solve the problem.
    通常情况下，每个发行版都会包含默认打过补丁的 `GNU Make 3.82` 。然后一些发行版，比如 Debian， 把 `GNU Make 3.82` 作为一个可选项，就是没有打过补丁的。你将会在这类发行版本上看到这个错误。切换到 `GNU Make 3.81` 或者对你的 `make` 打补丁可以解决这个问题。

### 2.3.9. 无依赖关系的构建[¶][426]

To build a specific recipe (`.bb` file), you can use the following command form:
要构建一个特定的 recipe（`.bb` 文件），你可以使用下面的命令：

```
     $ bitbake -b somepath/somerecipe.bb

```

This command form does not check for dependencies. Consequently, you should use it only when you know existing dependencies have been met.
这个命令格式不会检查依赖关系。因此，你应该在确定已存在的依赖关系满足条件的下使用这中命令。

### Note

You can also specify fragments of the filename. In this case, BitBake checks for a unique match.
你也可以指定文件的部分名称。这种情况下 BitBake 会进行一次唯一的检查。

### 2.3.10. Recipe 日志机制[¶][427]

The Yocto Project provides several logging functions for producing debugging output and reporting errors and warnings. For Python functions, the following logging functions exist. All of these functions log to `${T}/log.do_` _`task`_ , and can also log to standard output (stdout) with the right settings:
Yocto 项目提供多个日志函数来产生调试输出和报告错误和警告。对于 Python 函数，有下面的日志函数。通过正确的设置，所有这些函数会保存日志到 `${T}/log.do_` _`task`_，也会将日志输出到标准输出（stdout）。

*   `bb.plain(` _`msg`_ `)`: Writes  _`msg`_  as is to the log while also logging to stdout.
*   `bb.plain(` _`msg`_ `)`: 将 _`msg`_ 原封不动的写入日志和标准输出。

*   `bb.note(` _`msg`_ `)`: Writes "NOTE:  _`msg`_ " to the log. Also logs to stdout if BitBake is called with "-v".
*   `bb.note(` _`msg`_ `)`: 将 "NOTE:  _`msg`_ " 写入日志。如果传给了 BitBake 参数 “-v"，同时日志也会输出到标准输出。

*   `bb.debug(` _`level`_ `, ` _`msg`_ `)`: Writes "DEBUG:  _`msg`_ " to the log. Also logs to stdout if the log level is greater than or equal to  _`level`_ . See the "[-D][794]" option in the BitBake User Manual for more information.
*   `bb.debug(` _`level`_ `, ` _`msg`_ `)`:  将 "DEBUG:  _`msg`_ " 写入日志。同时也会将日志等级高于 _`level`_ 的日志输出到标准输出。参见 BitBake User Manual 中的 "[-D][794]".

*   `bb.warn(` _`msg`_ `)`: Writes "WARNING:  _`msg`_ " to the log while also logging to stdout.
*   `bb.warn(` _`msg`_ `)`: 将 "WARNING:  _`msg`_ " 写入日志，同时也会传输到标准输出。

*   `bb.error(` _`msg`_ `)`: Writes "ERROR:  _`msg`_ " to the log while also logging to stdout.
*   `bb.error(` _`msg`_ `)`: 将 "ERROR:  _`msg`_ " 写入日志，同时也会传输到标准输出

    ### Note

    Calling this function does not cause the task to fail.
    调用这个函数并不会造成 task 失败。

*   `bb.fatal(` _`msg`_ `)`: This logging function is similar to `bb.error(` _`msg`_ `)` but also causes the calling task to fail.
*   `bb.fatal(` _`msg`_ `)`: 这个日志函数类似 `bb.error(` _`msg`_ `)` ，但是会造成调用它的 task 失败。

    ### Note

    `bb.fatal()` raises an exception, which means you do not need to put a "return" statement after the function.
    `bb.fatal()` 会产生一个异常，也就意味着你不需要在这个函数以后防止一条 "return" 语句。

The same logging functions are also available in shell functions, under the names `bbplain`, `bbnote`, `bbdebug`, `bbwarn`, `bberror`, and `bbfatal`. The[`logging`][3764] class implements these functions. See that class in the `meta/classes` folder of the [Source Directory][3765] for information.
同样的日志函数也可以在 shell 函数中也有，如这些名字 `bbplain`, `bbnote`, `bbdebug`, `bbwarn`, `bberror`，和 `bbfatal`。[`logging`][3764] 类实现了这些函数。详情参见 [Source Directory][3765] 中的文件夹 `meta/classes`。

#### 2.3.10.1. 用 Python 记录日志[¶][22]

When creating recipes using Python and inserting code that handles build logs, keep in mind the goal is to have informative logs while keeping the console as "silent" as possible. Also, if you want status messages in the log, use the "debug" loglevel.

Following is an example written in Python. The code handles logging for a function that determines the number of tasks needed to be run. See the "[`do_listtasks`][3442]" section for additional information:

```
     python do_listtasks() {
         bb.debug(2, "Starting to figure out the task list")
         if noteworthy_condition:
             bb.note("There are 47 tasks to run")
         bb.debug(2, "Got to point xyz")
         if warning_trigger:
             bb.warn("Detected warning_trigger, this might be a problem later.")
         if recoverable_error:
             bb.error("Hit recoverable_error, you really need to fix this!")
         if fatal_error:
             bb.fatal("fatal_error detected, unable to print the task list")
         bb.plain("The tasks present are abc")
         bb.debug(2, "Finished figuring out the tasklist")
     }

```

#### 2.3.10.2. 用 Bash 记录日志[¶][23]

When creating recipes using Bash and inserting code that handles build logs, you have the same goals - informative with minimal console output. The syntax you use for recipes written in Bash is similar to that of recipes written in Python described in the previous section.

Following is an example written in Bash. The code logs the progress of the `do_my_function` function.

```
     do_my_function() {
         bbdebug 2 "Running do_my_function"
         if [ exceptional_condition ]; then
             bbnote "Hit exceptional_condition"
         fi
         bbdebug 2  "Got to point xyz"
         if [ warning_trigger ]; then
             bbwarn "Detected warning_trigger, this might cause a problem later."
         fi
         if [ recoverable_error ]; then
             bberror "Hit recoverable_error, correcting"
         fi
         if [ fatal_error ]; then
             bbfatal "fatal_error detected"
         fi
         bbdebug 2 "Completed do_my_function"
     }

```

### 2.3.11. 其他建议[¶][428]

Here are some other tips that you might find useful:
下面的建议你可能会觉得有用：

*   When adding new packages, it is worth watching for undesirable items making their way into compiler command lines. For example, you do not want references to local system files like `/usr/lib/` or `/usr/include/`.

*   If you want to remove the `psplash` boot splashscreen, add `psplash=false` to the kernel command line. Doing so prevents `psplash` from loading and thus allows you to see the console. It is also possible to switch out of the splashscreen by switching the virtual console (e.g. Fn+Left or Fn+Right on a Zaurus).

*   Removing [`TMPDIR`][795] (usually `tmp/`, within the [Build Directory][796]) can often fix temporary build issues. Removing `TMPDIR` is usually a relatively cheap operation, because task output will be cached in [`SSTATE_DIR`][797] (usually `sstate-cache/`, which is also in the Build Directory).

    ### Note

    Removing `TMPDIR` might be a workaround rather than a fix. Consequently, trying to determine the underlying cause of an issue before removing the directory is a good idea.

*   Understanding how a feature is used in practice within existing recipes can be very helpful. It is recommended that you configure some method that allows you to quickly search through files.

    Using GNU Grep, you can use the following shell function to recursively search through common recipe-related files, skipping binary files, `.git`directories, and the Build Directory (assuming its name starts with "build"):

    ```
         g() {
             grep -Ir \
                  --exclude-dir=.git \
                  --exclude-dir='build*' \
                  --include='*.bb*' \
                  --include='*.inc*' \
                  --include='*.conf*' \
                  --include='*.py*' \
                  "$@"
         }

    ```

    Following are some usage examples:

    ```
         $ g FOO    # Search recursively for "FOO"
         $ g -i foo # Search recursively for "foo", ignoring case
         $ g -w FOO # Search recursively for "FOO" as a word, ignoring e.g. "FOOBAR"

    ```

    If figuring out how some feature works requires a lot of searching, it might indicate that the documentation should be extended or improved. In such cases, consider filing a documentation bug using the Yocto Project implementation of [Bugzilla][798]. For general information on how to submit a bug against the Yocto Project, see the "[Tracking Bugs][799]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

    ### Note

    The manuals might not be the right place to document variables that are purely internal and have a limited scope (e.g. internal variables used to implement a single `.bbclass` file).

### 2.4. 维护构建输出的质量[¶][800]

Many factors can influence the quality of a build. For example, if you upgrade a recipe to use a new version of an upstream software package or you experiment with some new configuration options, subtle changes can occur that you might not detect until later. Consider the case where your recipe is using a newer version of an upstream package. In this case, a new version of a piece of software might introduce an optional dependency on another library, which is auto-detected. If that library has already been built when the software is building, the software will link to the built library and that library will be pulled into your image along with the new software even if you did not want the library.
很多因素会影响构建的质量。举个例子，如果你使用上游软件包的新版本升级你的 recpie，或者你试验一些新的配置选项，发生的微妙的变化你当时不会发现，知道后期才会知道。考虑下这种情况：你的脚本使用新版本的上游软件包。在这种情况下，软件某部分的新版本会引入一个对另一个库的依赖，而这些是自动探测道德。如果在构建这个软件时这个库已经构建了，那么软件就会链接这个构件好的库，同时这个库也会和新软件一起被拉入你的镜像，即使你并不想要这个库。

The [`buildhistory`][4175] class exists to help you maintain the quality of your build output. You can use the class to highlight unexpected and possibly unwanted changes in the build output. When you enable build history, it records information about the contents of each package and image and then commits that information to a local Git repository where you can examine the information.
[`buildhistory`][4175] class 的存在可以帮助你维持你的构建结果的质量。你可以使用这个 class 在构建结果中突出显示非预期的可能不想要的变化。当你市政了构建历史，他可以记录关于每个包和镜像的信息，然后提交信息到本地一个 Git 仓库，在这里你可以检查这些信息。

The remainder of this section describes the following:
本节剩下的部分会描述下面的问题：

*   How you can enable and disable build history
*   你如何打开/关闭构建历史功能

*   How to understand what the build history contains
*   如何理解构建历史包含了哪些内容

*   How to limit the information used for build history
*   如何限制用于构建历史的信息

*   How to examine the build history from both a command-line and web interface
*   如何通过命令行和 web 接口检查构建历史

### 2.4.1. 打开和关闭构建历史[¶][429]

Build history is disabled by default. To enable it, add the following `INHERIT` statement and set the [`BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT`][3766] variable to "1" at the end of your `conf/local.conf` file found in the [Build Directory][3767]:

```
     INHERIT += "buildhistory"
     BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT = "1"

```

Enabling build history as previously described causes the build process to collect build output information and commit it to a local [Git][3768] repository.

### Note

Enabling build history increases your build times slightly, particularly for images, and increases the amount of disk space used during the build.

You can disable build history by removing the previous statements from your `conf/local.conf` file.

### 2.4.2. 理解构建历史都包含那些内容[¶][430]

Build history information is kept in `${`[`TOPDIR`][3769]`}/buildhistory` in the Build Directory as defined by the [`BUILDHISTORY_DIR`][3770] variable. The following is an example abbreviated listing:

| 
![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/buildhistory.png)
 |

At the top level, there is a `metadata-revs` file that lists the revisions of the repositories for the layers enabled when the build was produced. The rest of the data splits into separate `packages`, `images` and `sdk` directories, the contents of which are described below.

#### 2.4.2.1. 构建历史软件包信息[¶][24]

The history for each package contains a text file that has name-value pairs with information about the package. For example, `buildhistory/packages/i586-poky-linux/busybox/busybox/latest` contains the following:

```
     PV = 1.22.1
     PR = r32
     RPROVIDES =
     RDEPENDS = glibc (>= 2.20) update-alternatives-opkg
     RRECOMMENDS = busybox-syslog busybox-udhcpc update-rc.d
     PKGSIZE = 540168
     FILES = /usr/bin/* /usr/sbin/* /usr/lib/busybox/* /usr/lib/lib*.so.* \
        /etc /com /var /bin/* /sbin/* /lib/*.so.* /lib/udev/rules.d \
        /usr/lib/udev/rules.d /usr/share/busybox /usr/lib/busybox/* \
        /usr/share/pixmaps /usr/share/applications /usr/share/idl \
        /usr/share/omf /usr/share/sounds /usr/lib/bonobo/servers
     FILELIST = /bin/busybox /bin/busybox.nosuid /bin/busybox.suid /bin/sh \
        /etc/busybox.links.nosuid /etc/busybox.links.suid

```

Most of these name-value pairs correspond to variables used to produce the package. The exceptions are `FILELIST`, which is the actual list of files in the package, and `PKGSIZE`, which is the total size of files in the package in bytes.

There is also a file corresponding to the recipe from which the package came (e.g. `buildhistory/packages/i586-poky-linux/busybox/latest`):

```
     PV = 1.22.1
     PR = r32
     DEPENDS = initscripts kern-tools-native update-rc.d-native \
        virtual/i586-poky-linux-compilerlibs virtual/i586-poky-linux-gcc \
        virtual/libc virtual/update-alternatives
     PACKAGES = busybox-ptest busybox-httpd busybox-udhcpd busybox-udhcpc \
        busybox-syslog busybox-mdev busybox-hwclock busybox-dbg \
        busybox-staticdev busybox-dev busybox-doc busybox-locale busybox

```

Finally, for those recipes fetched from a version control system (e.g., Git), a file exists that lists source revisions that are specified in the recipe and lists the actual revisions used during the build. Listed and actual revisions might differ when [`SRCREV`][3443] is set to `${[AUTOREV][1816]}`. Here is an example assuming`buildhistory/packages/qemux86-poky-linux/linux-yocto/latest_srcrev`):

```
     # SRCREV_machine = "38cd560d5022ed2dbd1ab0dca9642e47c98a0aa1"
     SRCREV_machine = "38cd560d5022ed2dbd1ab0dca9642e47c98a0aa1"
     # SRCREV_meta = "a227f20eff056e511d504b2e490f3774ab260d6f"
     SRCREV_meta = "a227f20eff056e511d504b2e490f3774ab260d6f"

```

You can use the `buildhistory-collect-srcrevs` command with the `-a` option to collect the stored `SRCREV` values from build history and report them in a format suitable for use in global configuration (e.g., `local.conf` or a distro include file) to override floating `AUTOREV` values to a fixed set of revisions. Here is some example output from this command:

```
     $ buildhistory-collect-srcrevs -a
     # i586-poky-linux
     SRCREV_pn-glibc = "b8079dd0d360648e4e8de48656c5c38972621072"
     SRCREV_pn-glibc-initial = "b8079dd0d360648e4e8de48656c5c38972621072"
     SRCREV_pn-opkg-utils = "53274f087565fd45d8452c5367997ba6a682a37a"
     SRCREV_pn-kmod = "fd56638aed3fe147015bfa10ed4a5f7491303cb4"
     # x86_64-linux
     SRCREV_pn-gtk-doc-stub-native = "1dea266593edb766d6d898c79451ef193eb17cfa"
     SRCREV_pn-dtc-native = "65cc4d2748a2c2e6f27f1cf39e07a5dbabd80ebf"
     SRCREV_pn-update-rc.d-native = "eca680ddf28d024954895f59a241a622dd575c11"
     SRCREV_glibc_pn-cross-localedef-native = "b8079dd0d360648e4e8de48656c5c38972621072"
     SRCREV_localedef_pn-cross-localedef-native = "c833367348d39dad7ba018990bfdaffaec8e9ed3"
     SRCREV_pn-prelink-native = "faa069deec99bf61418d0bab831c83d7c1b797ca"
     SRCREV_pn-opkg-utils-native = "53274f087565fd45d8452c5367997ba6a682a37a"
     SRCREV_pn-kern-tools-native = "23345b8846fe4bd167efdf1bd8a1224b2ba9a5ff"
     SRCREV_pn-kmod-native = "fd56638aed3fe147015bfa10ed4a5f7491303cb4"
     # qemux86-poky-linux
     SRCREV_machine_pn-linux-yocto = "38cd560d5022ed2dbd1ab0dca9642e47c98a0aa1"
     SRCREV_meta_pn-linux-yocto = "a227f20eff056e511d504b2e490f3774ab260d6f"
     # all-poky-linux
     SRCREV_pn-update-rc.d = "eca680ddf28d024954895f59a241a622dd575c11"

```

### Note

Here are some notes on using the `buildhistory-collect-srcrevs` command:

*   By default, only values where the `SRCREV` was not hardcoded (usually when `AUTOREV` was used) are reported. Use the `-a` option to see all `SRCREV` values.

*   The output statements might not have any effect if overrides are applied elsewhere in the build system configuration. Use the `-f`option to add the `forcevariable` override to each output line if you need to work around this restriction.

*   The script does apply special handling when building for multiple machines. However, the script does place a comment before each set of values that specifies which triplet to which they belong as shown above (e.g., `i586-poky-linux`).

#### 2.4.2.2. 构建历史镜像信息[¶][25]

The files produced for each image are as follows:

*   `image-files:` A directory containing selected files from the root filesystem. The files are defined by [`BUILDHISTORY_IMAGE_FILES`][431].

*   `build-id.txt:` Human-readable information about the build configuration and metadata source revisions. This file contains the full build header as printed by BitBake.

*   `*.dot:` Dependency graphs for the image that are compatible with `graphviz`.

*   `files-in-image.txt:` A list of files in the image with permissions, owner, group, size, and symlink information.

*   `image-info.txt:` A text file containing name-value pairs with information about the image. See the following listing example for more information.

*   `installed-package-names.txt:` A list of installed packages by name only.

*   `installed-package-sizes.txt:` A list of installed packages ordered by size.

*   `installed-packages.txt:` A list of installed packages with full package filenames.

### Note

Installed package information is able to be gathered and produced even if package management is disabled for the final image.

Here is an example of `image-info.txt`:

```
     DISTRO = poky
     DISTRO_VERSION = 1.7
     USER_CLASSES = buildstats image-mklibs image-prelink
     IMAGE_CLASSES = image_types
     IMAGE_FEATURES = debug-tweaks
     IMAGE_LINGUAS =
     IMAGE_INSTALL = packagegroup-core-boot run-postinsts
     BAD_RECOMMENDATIONS =
     NO_RECOMMENDATIONS =
     PACKAGE_EXCLUDE =
     ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND = write_package_manifest; license_create_manifest; \
        write_image_manifest ; buildhistory_list_installed_image ; \
        buildhistory_get_image_installed ; ssh_allow_empty_password;  \
        postinst_enable_logging; rootfs_update_timestamp ; ssh_disable_dns_lookup ;
     IMAGE_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND =   buildhistory_get_imageinfo ;
     IMAGESIZE = 6900

```

Other than `IMAGESIZE`, which is the total size of the files in the image in Kbytes, the name-value pairs are variables that may have influenced the content of the image. This information is often useful when you are trying to determine why a change in the package or file listings has occurred.

#### 2.4.2.3. Using Build History to Gather Image Information Only[¶][26]

As you can see, build history produces image information, including dependency graphs, so you can see why something was pulled into the image. If you are just interested in this information and not interested in collecting specific package or SDK information, you can enable writing only image information without any history by adding the following to your `conf/local.conf` file found in the [Build Directory][3444]:

```
     INHERIT += "buildhistory"
     BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT = "0"
     BUILDHISTORY_FEATURES = "image"

```

Here, you set the [`BUILDHISTORY_FEATURES`][3445] variable to use the image feature only.

#### 2.4.2.4. 构建历史SDK信息[¶][27]

Build history collects similar information on the contents of SDKs (e.g. `bitbake -c populate_sdk imagename`) as compared to information it collects for images. Furthermore, this information differs depending on whether an extensible or standard SDK is being produced.

The following list shows the files produced for SDKs:

*   `files-in-sdk.txt:` A list of files in the SDK with permissions, owner, group, size, and symlink information. This list includes both the host and target parts of the SDK.

*   `sdk-info.txt:` A text file containing name-value pairs with information about the SDK. See the following listing example for more information.

*   `sstate-task-sizes.txt:` A text file containing name-value pairs with information about task group sizes (e.g. `do_populate_sysroot` tasks have a total size). The `sstate-task-sizes.txt` file exists only when an extensible SDK is created.

*   `sstate-package-sizes.txt:` A text file containing name-value pairs with information for the shared-state packages and sizes in the SDK. The `sstate-package-sizes.txt` file exists only when an extensible SDK is created.

*   `sdk-files:` A folder that contains copies of the files mentioned in `BUILDHISTORY_SDK_FILES` if the files are present in the output. Additionally, the default value of `BUILDHISTORY_SDK_FILES` is specific to the extensible SDK although you can set it differently if you would like to pull in specific files from the standard SDK.

    The default files are `conf/local.conf`, `conf/bblayers.conf`, `conf/auto.conf`, `conf/locked-sigs.inc`, and `conf/devtool.conf`. Thus, for an extensible SDK, these files get copied into the `sdk-files` directory.

*   The following information appears under each of the `host` and `target` directories for the portions of the SDK that run on the host and on the target, respectively:

    ### Note

    The following files for the most part are empty when producing an extensible SDK because this type of SDK is not constructed from packages as is the standard SDK.

    *   `depends.dot:` Dependency graph for the SDK that is compatible with `graphviz`.

    *   `installed-package-names.txt:` A list of installed packages by name only.

    *   `installed-package-sizes.txt:` A list of installed packages ordered by size.

    *   `installed-packages.txt:` A list of installed packages with full package filenames.

Here is an example of `sdk-info.txt`:

```
     DISTRO = poky
     DISTRO_VERSION = 1.3+snapshot-20130327
     SDK_NAME = poky-glibc-i686-arm
     SDK_VERSION = 1.3+snapshot
     SDKMACHINE =
     SDKIMAGE_FEATURES = dev-pkgs dbg-pkgs
     BAD_RECOMMENDATIONS =
     SDKSIZE = 352712

```

Other than `SDKSIZE`, which is the total size of the files in the SDK in Kbytes, the name-value pairs are variables that might have influenced the content of the SDK. This information is often useful when you are trying to determine why a change in the package or file listings has occurred.

#### 2.4.2.5. 检查构建历史信息[¶][28]

You can examine build history output from the command line or from a web interface.

To see any changes that have occurred (assuming you have [`BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT = "1"`][3446]), you can simply use any Git command that allows you to view the history of a repository. Here is one method:

```
      $ git log -p

```

You need to realize, however, that this method does show changes that are not significant (e.g. a package's size changing by a few bytes).

A command-line tool called `buildhistory-diff` does exist, though, that queries the Git repository and prints just the differences that might be significant in human-readable form. Here is an example:

```
     $ ~/poky/poky/scripts/buildhistory-diff . HEAD^
     Changes to images/qemux86_64/glibc/core-image-minimal (files-in-image.txt):
        /etc/anotherpkg.conf was added
        /sbin/anotherpkg was added
        * (installed-package-names.txt):
        *   anotherpkg was added
     Changes to images/qemux86_64/glibc/core-image-minimal (installed-package-names.txt):
        anotherpkg was added
     packages/qemux86_64-poky-linux/v86d: PACKAGES: added "v86d-extras"
        * PR changed from "r0" to "r1"
        * PV changed from "0.1.10" to "0.1.12"
     packages/qemux86_64-poky-linux/v86d/v86d: PKGSIZE changed from 110579 to 144381 (+30%)
        * PR changed from "r0" to "r1"
        * PV changed from "0.1.10" to "0.1.12"

```

### Note

The `buildhistory-diff` tool requires the `GitPython` package. Be sure to install it using Pip3 as follows:
```
   $ pip3 install GitPython --user

```
Alternatively, you can install `python3-git` using the appropriate distribution package manager (e.g. `apt-get`, `dnf`, or `zipper`).

To see changes to the build history using a web interface, follow the instruction in the `README` file here.[http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/buildhistory-web/][3447].

Here is a sample screenshot of the interface:

### 2.5. 加速构建[¶][801]

Build time can be an issue. By default, the build system uses simple controls to try and maximize build efficiency. In general, the default settings for all the following variables result in the most efficient build times when dealing with single socket systems (i.e. a single CPU). If you have multiple CPUs, you might try increasing the default values to gain more speed. See the descriptions in the glossary for each variable for more information:
构建时间可能会成为一个问题。默认情况下，构建系统使用简单的控制来尝试和最大化构建效率。通常，在单个socket 系统（比如，一个CPU）的情况下，对下面全部变量的默认配置可以产生最有效率的构建时间。如果你有多个 CPU，你可能通过提高默认值来获得更快的速度。在术语表中查看每个变量的描述可以获得更多信息：

*   [`BB_NUMBER_THREADS`:][1817] The maximum number of threads BitBake simultaneously executes.
*   [`BB_NUMBER_THREADS`:][1817]  BitBake 同时可以执行的最大线程数。

*   [`BB_NUMBER_PARSE_THREADS`:][1818] The number of threads BitBake uses during parsing.
*   [`BB_NUMBER_PARSE_THREADS`:][1818] 在解析过程中 BitBake 可以使用的最大线程数。

*   [`PARALLEL_MAKE`:][1819] Extra options passed to the `make` command during the [`do_compile`][1820] task in order to specify parallel compilation on the local build host.
*   [`PARALLEL_MAKE`:][1819] 在执行 [`do_compile`][1820] task 时传给 `make` 命令的额外参数，目的是在本地构建主机上指定并行编译。

*   [`PARALLEL_MAKEINST`:][1821] Extra options passed to the `make` command during the [`do_install`][1822] task in order to specify parallel installation on the local build host.
*   [`PARALLEL_MAKEINST`:][1821] 在执行 [`do_install`][1822] task 时传给 `make` 命令的额外参数，目的是在本地构建主机上指定并行安装。

As mentioned, these variables all scale to the number of processor cores available on the build system. For single socket systems, this auto-scaling ensures that the build system fundamentally takes advantage of potential parallel operations during the build based on the build machine's capabilities.
如上所述，这些变量全都和构建系统上可用的处理器核心数关联。对于单个socket 系统，这会自动缩小以保证构建系统在构建过程中根据机器的能力根本上利用潜在并行操作性能。

Following are additional factors that can affect build speed:
下面是额外的可以影响构建速度的因素：

*   File system type: The file system type that the build is being performed on can also influence performance. Using `ext4` is recommended as compared to `ext2` and `ext3` due to `ext4` improved features such as extents.
*   文件系统类型： 构建运行的的文件系统类型可能会影响性能。相对于 `ext2` 和`ext3`，推荐使用 `ext4`，应为`ext4`提高了性能，比如范围

*   Disabling the updating of access time using `noatime`: The `noatime` mount option prevents the build system from updating file and directory access times.
*   通过 `noatime` 禁止更新访问时间：`noatime` 挂载操作会组织构建系统更新文件和目录的访问时间。

*   Setting a longer commit: Using the "commit=" mount option increases the interval in seconds between disk cache writes. Changing this interval from the five second default to something longer increases the risk of data loss but decreases the need to write to the disk, thus increasing the build performance.
*   设置一个更长提交：使用 “commit=” 挂载选项提高磁盘缓存写之间的间隔。改变这个间隔，从默认的5秒改为更长的间隔会增加数据丢失的风险，但会减少写磁盘的需求，从而提高构建性能。

*   Choosing the packaging backend: Of the available packaging backends, IPK is the fastest. Additionally, selecting a singular packaging backend also helps.
*   挑选打包后端：在可用的打包后端中，IPK是最快的。额外的，挑选一个打包后端同样也有帮助。

*   Using `tmpfs` for [`TMPDIR`][1823] as a temporary file system: While this can help speed up the build, the benefits are limited due to the compiler using `-pipe`. The build system goes to some lengths to avoid `sync()` calls into the file system on the principle that if there was a significant failure, the [Build Directory][1824] contents could easily be rebuilt.
*   为 [`TMPDIR`][1823] 使用 `tmpfs` 作为临时文件系统：这条可以加速构建，好处比较有限，因为编译器会使用 `-pipe`。理论上构建系统会去一些长度来避免调用 `sync()` 到文件系统，只要没有发生明显的错误，[Build Directory][1824] 的内容可以很轻松的重建。

*   Inheriting the [`rm_work`][1825] class: Inheriting this class has shown to speed up builds due to significantly lower amounts of data stored in the data cache as well as on disk. Inheriting this class also makes cleanup of [`TMPDIR`][1826] faster, at the expense of being easily able to dive into the source code. File system maintainers have recommended that the fastest way to clean up large numbers of files is to reformat partitions rather than delete files due to the linear nature of partitions. This, of course, assumes you structure the disk partitions and file systems in a way that this is practical.
*   继承 [`rm_work`][1825] class：继承这个 class 已经被证明加速构建，因为会显著的减少在数据缓存和磁盘上的数据使用量。继承这个 class 也会更快的清理 [`TMPDIR`][1826]，这是以能够轻松的进入源代码为代价的。文件系统维护者推荐最快的清理大量文件的方法是重新格式化分区而不是删除文件，这是因为分区线性的天性。这也就是假设你是以通用的方法对磁盘和文件系统分区的。

Aside from the previous list, you should keep some trade offs in mind that can help you speed up the build:
除了前面的列表，你应该考虑一些取舍来帮助你加速构建：

*   Remove items from [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][1827] that you might not need.
*   从 [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][1827] 删除些你可能不需要的文件。

*   Exclude debug symbols and other debug information: If you do not need these symbols and other debug information, disabling the `*-dbg` package generation can speed up the build. You can disable this generation by setting the [`INHIBIT_PACKAGE_DEBUG_SPLIT`][1828] variable to "1".
*   去除调试符号和其它调试信息：如果你不需要这些符号和其它调试信息，禁止产生 `*-dbg` 包可以加速构建。你可以通过将 [`INHIBIT_PACKAGE_DEBUG_SPLIT`][1828] 设置为 "1" 来禁止产生这些包。

*   Disable static library generation for recipes derived from `autoconf` or `libtool`: Following is an example showing how to disable static libraries and still provide an override to handle exceptions:
*   禁止从 `autoconf` 或 `libtool` 的 recipe 产生静态库：下面是一个例子，演示了如何禁止静态库和仍然提供重载异常处理：

    ```
         STATICLIBCONF = "--disable-static"
         STATICLIBCONF_sqlite3-native = ""
         EXTRA_OECONF += "${STATICLIBCONF}"

    ```

    ### Notes

    *   Some recipes need static libraries in order to work correctly (e.g. `pseudo-native` needs `sqlite3-native`). Overrides, as in the previous example, account for these kinds of exceptions.
    *   一些 recipe 需要静态库才能正常工作（比如，`pseude-native` 需要 `sqlite3-native`。重载，就如上面的例子，考虑这些类型的异常。

    *   Some packages have packaging code that assumes the presence of the static libraries. If so, you might need to exclude them as well.
    *   一些软件包已经打包了代码，假设了静态库的存在。如果是这样，你可能就需要排除他们。

### Chapter 3. 近观 Yocto 项目开发环境[¶][1829]

This chapter takes a more detailed look at the Yocto Project development environment. The following diagram represents the development environment at a high level. The remainder of this chapter expands on the fundamental input, output, process, and [Metadata][4525]) blocks in the Yocto Project development environment.
本章将会详细的介绍 Yocto 项目开发环境。下面的图表充高层次展示了开发环境。本章剩余的部分会展开 Yocto 项目开发环境的基础输入、输出、处理和[元数据][4525] 块。


![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/yocto-environment-ref.png)


The generalized Yocto Project Development Environment consists of several functional areas:
生成好的 Yocto 项目开发环境由下面几个功能块组成：

*   _User Configuration:_  Metadata you can use to control the build process.
*   _User Configuration:_  你可以用来控制构建过程的元数据。

*   _Metadata Layers:_  Various layers that provide software, machine, and distro Metadata.
*   _Metadata Layers:_  多种 layer 用来提供软件、机器和发行版元数据。

*   _Source Files:_  Upstream releases, local projects, and SCMs.
*   _Source Files:_ 上游发布的，本地项目，和 SCM。

*   _Build System:_  Processes under the control of [BitBake][3455]. This block expands on how BitBake fetches source, applies patches, completes compilation, analyzes output for package generation, creates and tests packages, generates images, and generates cross-development tools.
*   _Build System:_  [BitBake][3455] 控制的程序。这一块会展开 BitBake 如何获取代码，应用补丁，完成编译，分析包的生成结果、创建和测试软件包，生成镜像，以及生成交叉编译工具链。

*   _Package Feeds:_  Directories containing output packages (RPM, DEB or IPK), which are subsequently used in the construction of an image or SDK, produced by the build system. These feeds can also be copied and shared using a web server or other means to facilitate extending or updating existing images on devices at runtime if runtime package management is enabled.
*   _Package Feeds:_  包含生成的软件包（RPM、DEB或 IPK）的目录，是构造镜像或 SDK 的子过程，通过构建系统生成。 这些源头可以通过web 服务器拷贝和共享，或者其他途径来提高扩展性或在运行时更新已有的镜像，如果运行时软件包管理是使能的。

*   _Images:_  Images produced by the development process.
*   _Images:_  开发过程产生的镜像。

*   _Application Development SDK:_  Cross-development tools that are produced along with an image or separately with BitBake.
*   _Application Development SDK:_  BitBake 生成的、和镜像一起的或单独的交叉编译工具。

### 3.1. 用户配置[¶][817]

User configuration helps define the build. Through user configuration, you can tell BitBake the target architecture for which you are building the image, where to store downloaded source, and other build properties.
用户配置帮助定义构建过程。通过用户配置，你可以告诉 BitBake 你构建的镜像是什么架构，在哪里保存下载的源码，以及其他属性。

The following figure shows an expanded representation of the "User Configuration" box of the [general Yocto Project Development Environment figure][4176]:
下面的表格展示了一个[通用 Yocto 项目开发环境表格][4176]的展开的表现用户配置的盒子。

![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/user-configuration.png)

BitBake needs some basic configuration files in order to complete a build. These files are `*.conf` files. The minimally necessary ones reside as example files in the [Source Directory][4177]. For simplicity, this section refers to the Source Directory as the "Poky Directory."
BitBake 需要一些基本的配置文件来完成构建。这些文件是 `*.conf`。最少需要的文件是位于 [Source Directory][4177] 作为例子的文件。简单来说，这部分 Source Directory 被称为 "Poky Directory" 。

When you clone the `poky` Git repository or you download and unpack a Yocto Project release, you can set up the Source Directory to be named anything you want. For this discussion, the cloned repository uses the default name `poky`.
当你克隆 `poky` git 仓库或者下载、解压缩 Yocto项目发布版之后，你可以设置 Source Directory为任何你想要的名字。为了讨论，接下来克隆的仓库会使用默认名字 `poky`。

### Note

The Poky repository is primarily an aggregation of existing repositories. It is not a canonical upstream source.
Poky 仓库是基本是一些存在的仓库的集合。它不是一个典型上游源。

The `meta-poky` layer inside Poky contains a `conf` directory that has example configuration files. These example files are used as a basis for creating actual configuration files when you source the build environment script (i.e. [`oe-init-build-env`][4178] or [`oe-init-build-env-memres`][4179]).
在 Poky 中的 `meta-poky` layer 包含一个 `conf` 目录有一些配置文件的例子。这些示例文件是当你执行构建环境脚本时创建实际配置文件的基础。（比如 `oe-init-build-env`][4178] 或者 [`oe-init-build-env-memres`][4179]）。

Sourcing the build environment script creates a [Build Directory][4180] if one does not already exist. BitBake uses the Build Directory for all its work during builds. The Build Directory has a `conf` directory that contains default versions of your `local.conf` and `bblayers.conf` configuration files. These default configuration files are created only if versions do not already exist in the Build Directory at the time you source the build environment setup script.
执行构建环境脚本时，如果 [Build Directory][4180] 不存在就会创建一个。BitBake 在整个构建工作过程中都使用 Build Directory。这个 Build Directory 有一个 `conf` 目录保存了你的默认版本的`local.conf` 和`bblayers.conf` 配置文件。如果你在执行构建环境脚本时， Build Directory 没有配置文件，就会创建这些默认的配置文件。

Because the Poky repository is fundamentally an aggregation of existing repositories, some users might be familiar with running the `oe-init-build-env` or `oe-init-build-env-memres` script in the context of separate OpenEmbedded-Core and BitBake repositories rather than a single Poky repository. This discussion assumes the script is executed from within a cloned or unpacked version of Poky.
因为 Poky 仓库根本上师一些现存仓库的聚集，有些用户可能会熟悉在分开的 OpenEmbedded-Core 和BitBake 仓库而不是单独的 Poky 仓库中运行 `oe-init-build-env` 或 `oe-init-build-env-memres` 脚本。下面的讨论假设脚本是在一个克隆的或者解压缩班的 Poky 中执行的。

Depending on where the script is sourced, different sub-scripts are called to set up the Build Directory (Yocto or OpenEmbedded). Specifically, the script `scripts/oe-setup-builddir` inside the poky directory sets up the Build Directory and seeds the directory (if necessary) with configuration files appropriate for the Yocto Project development environment.
根据脚本是在何处执行的，不同的子脚本会被调用来搭建 Build Directory（Yocto 或者 OpenEmbedded）。特别的，在 poky 目录中的脚本 `scripts/oe-setup-builddir` 配合适合 Yocto 项目开发环境的配置文件搭建 Build Directory 和 seed 目录（如果必要）。

### Note

The `scripts/oe-setup-builddir` script uses the `$TEMPLATECONF` variable to determine which sample configuration files to locate.
`scripts/oe-setup-builddir` 脚本使用变量 `$TEMPLATECONF` 来决定要定位那个示例配置文件。

The `local.conf` file provides many basic variables that define a build environment. Here is a list of a few. To see the default configurations in a `local.conf` file created by the build environment script, see the `local.conf.sample` in the `meta-poky` layer:
`local.conf` 文件提供了很多定义构建环境的基础变量。这里的列表是很少的一部分。要查看由构建环境脚本创建的 `local.conf` 文件中的默认配置，可以看 `meta-poky` layer 中的 `local.conf.sample`：

*   _Parallelism Options:_  Controlled by the [`BB_NUMBER_THREADS`][1830], [`PARALLEL_MAKE`][1831], and [`BB_NUMBER_PARSE_THREADS`][1832] variables.
*   _Parallelism Options:_  受变量 [`BB_NUMBER_THREADS`][1830], [`PARALLEL_MAKE`][1831], 和[`BB_NUMBER_PARSE_THREADS`][1832] 控制.

*   _Target Machine Selection:_  Controlled by the [`MACHINE`][1833] variable.
*   _Target Machine Selection:_  由变量 [`MACHINE`][1833] 控制.

*   _Download Directory:_  Controlled by the [`DL_DIR`][1834] variable.
*   _Download Directory:_  由变量 [`DL_DIR`][1834] 控制.

*   _Shared State Directory:_  Controlled by the [`SSTATE_DIR`][1835] variable.
*   _Shared State Directory:_  由变量 [`SSTATE_DIR`][1835] 控制.

*   _Build Output:_  Controlled by the [`TMPDIR`][1836] variable.
*   _Build Output:_  由变量 [`TMPDIR`][1836] 控制.

### Note

Configurations set in the `conf/local.conf` file can also be set in the `conf/site.conf` and `conf/auto.conf` configuration files.
`conf/local.conf` 设置的配置也可以被设置在 `conf/site.conf` 和 `conf/auto.conf` 配置文件。

The `bblayers.conf` file tells BitBake what layers you want considered during the build. By default, the layers listed in this file include layers minimally needed by the build system. However, you must manually add any custom layers you have created. You can find more information on working with the `bblayers.conf` file in the "[Enabling Your Layer][4181]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.
`bblayers.conf` 配置文件告诉 BitBake 在构建过程中要关注那些 layer。默认情况下，在该文件列出的 layer 包含了构建系统需要的最少 layer。然而你必须手动添加任何你自己创建的自定义的 layer 。你可以通过配合 Yocto Project Development Manual 中 [Enabling Your Layer][4181]" 一节的 `bblayers.conf` 获取更多的信息。

The files `site.conf` and `auto.conf` are not created by the environment initialization script. If you want the `site.conf` file, you need to create that yourself. The `auto.conf` file is typically created by an autobuilder:
`site.conf` 和 `auto.conf` 不是由环境初始化脚本创建的。如果你想要 `site.conf` 配置文件，你需要自己创建它。 `auto.conf` 通常是由自动构建器（autobuilder）创建的：

*   _`site.conf`:_  You can use the `conf/site.conf` configuration file to configure multiple build directories. For example, suppose you had several build environments and they shared some common features. You can set these default build properties here. A good example is perhaps the packaging format to use through the [`PACKAGE_CLASSES`][1837] variable.
*   _`site.conf`:_  你可以使用配置文件 `conf/site.conf` 来配置多个构建目录。举个例子，假设你有几个构建环境，而且他们共享一些共同特性。你可以在这里设置这些默认构件属性。一个好例子可能是通过变量  [`PACKAGE_CLASSES`][1837]  设置打包格式。

    One useful scenario for using the `conf/site.conf` file is to extend your [`BBPATH`][1838] variable to include the path to a `conf/site.conf`. Then, when BitBake looks for Metadata using `BBPATH`, it finds the `conf/site.conf` file and applies your common configurations found in the file. To override configurations in a particular build directory, alter the similar configurations within that build directory's `conf/local.conf` file.
    一个有用的场景是使用 `conf/site.conf` 文件扩展你的 [`BBPATH`][1838] 变量，以此来包含 `conf/site.conf` 的路径。然后，当 BitBake 使用 `BBPATH` 查找元数据时，它就会找到文件 `conf/site.conf`，并且应用在这个文件中找到的你的通用配置。要重载特定构建目录的配置，就修改这个构建目录下的 `conf/local.conf` 中相似的配置。

*   _`auto.conf`:_  The file is usually created and written to by an autobuilder. The settings put into the file are typically the same as you would find in the `conf/local.conf` or the `conf/site.conf` files.
*   _`auto.conf`:_ 这个文件经常是由一个自动构建器创建和写入的。文件中的设置通常和你在文件 `conf/local.conf` 或 `conf/site.conf` 中找到的一样。

You can edit all configuration files to further define any particular build environment. This process is represented by the "User Configuration Edits" box in the figure.
你可以修改所有的配置文件为以后定义特殊的构建环境。这个过程在表格中的 "User Configuration Edits" 框展示。

When you launch your build with the `bitbake  _`target`_`  command, BitBake sorts out the configurations to ultimately define your build environment. It is important to understand that the OpenEmbedded build system reads the configuration files in a specific order: `site.conf`, `auto.conf`, and `local.conf`. And, the build system applies the normal assignment statement rules. Because the files are parsed in a specific order, variable assignments for the same variable could be affected. For example, if the `auto.conf` file and the `local.conf` set  _`variable1`_  to different values, because the build system parses `local.conf` after `auto.conf`,  _`variable1`_  is assigned the value from the `local.conf` file.
当你通过 `bitbake  _`target`_` 命令启动你的构建后，BitBake 会对配置文件进行排序，一遍最后定义你的构建环境。理解 OpenEmbedded 构建系统按照特定顺序读取配置文件非常重要：`site.conf`, `auto.conf`, 和 `local.conf`。然后，构建系统会应用普通的赋值语句规则。因为这些文件会按照特定的顺序解析，对同一变量的赋值会受影响。举个例子，如果 `auto.conf` 和 `local.conf` 为变量 _`variable1`_ 赋了不同的值，因为构建系统在 `auto.conf` 之后处理 `local.conf` ，所以 _`variable1`_ 会被赋予了 `local.conf` 文件中的值。

### 3.2. 元数据，机器配置，以及策略配置[¶][818]

The previous section described the user configurations that define BitBake's global behavior. This section takes a closer look at the layers the build system uses to further control the build. These layers provide Metadata for the software, machine, and policy.
前面章节表述了定义 BitBake 的全局动作的用户配置。这一章节会近距离观察构建系统用来控制以后行为的 layer。这些 layer 为软件、机器和策略提供元数据。

In general, three types of layer input exist:
通常来说，存在三种类型的 layer 输入：

*   _Policy Configuration:_  Distribution Layers provide top-level or general policies for the image or SDK being built. For example, this layer would dictate whether BitBake produces RPM or IPK packages.
*   _Policy Configuration:_ 分布的 layer提供构建镜像或者 SDK 的顶层或者通用策略。举个例子，这个 layer 将命令 BitBake 生成 RPM 或者 IPK 软件包。

*   _Machine Configuration:_  Board Support Package (BSP) layers provide machine configurations. This type of information is specific to a particular target architecture.
*   _Machine Configuration:_ BSP layer 提供机器配置。这类信息用来指定特定的目标架构。

*   _Metadata:_  Software layers contain user-supplied recipe files, patches, and append files.
*   _Metadata:_ 软件 layer 包含用户提供的 recipe 文件，补丁和 append 文件。

The following figure shows an expanded representation of the Metadata, Machine Configuration, and Policy Configuration input (layers) boxes of the[general Yocto Project Development Environment figure][4182]:
[general Yocto Project Development Environment figure][4182]，下面的表格展示了一个扩展的表示元数据，机器配置和策略配置的输入（layer）框


![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/layer-input.png)


In general, all layers have a similar structure. They all contain a licensing file (e.g. `COPYING`) if the layer is to be distributed, a `README` file as good practice and especially if the layer is to be distributed, a configuration directory, and recipe directories.
通常情况下全部的 layer 有类似的结构。他们全部，如果要发布就包含了版权文件（比如 `COPYING`），作为一个好习惯会有一个 `README` 文件，特别是如果这个 layer 要分发，还会有一个配置目录和和 recipe 目录。

The Yocto Project has many layers that can be used. You can see a web-interface listing of them on the [Source Repositories][4183] page. The layers are shown at the bottom categorized under "Yocto Metadata Layers." These layers are fundamentally a subset of the [OpenEmbedded Metadata Index][4184], which lists all layers provided by the OpenEmbedded community.
Yocto 项目有很多 layer 可以使用。在 [Source Repositories][4183] 页，你可以看到一个 web 接口列出他们。这些 layer 分类显示在 "Yocto Metadata Layers" 底部。这些 layer 根本上是 [OpenEmbedded Metadata Index][4184] 的一个子集，OpenEmbedded Metadata Index 列出了 OpenEmbedded 社区提供的全部 layer。

### Note

Layers exist in the Yocto Project Source Repositories that cannot be found in the OpenEmbedded Metadata Index. These layers are either deprecated or experimental in nature.
在 Yocto 项目原仓库中存在 layer 不会在 OpenEmbedded Metadata Index 中找到。这些 layer 本质上是弃用的的和具有实验性质的。

BitBake uses the `conf/bblayers.conf` file, which is part of the user configuration, to find what layers it should be using as part of the build.
BitBake 使用 `conf/bblayers.conf` 文件，是用户配置文件的一部分，来查找那些 layer 应该作为构建的一部分使用。

For more information on layers, see the "[Understanding and Creating Layers][4185]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.
更多关于 layer 的信息参见 Yocto Project Development Manual 的 "[Understanding and Creating Layers][4185]" 章节。

### 3.2.1. 分配 layer[¶][432]

The distribution layer provides policy configurations for your distribution. Best practices dictate that you isolate these types of configurations into their own layer. Settings you provide in `conf/distro/ _`distro`_ .conf` override similar settings that BitBake finds in your `conf/local.conf` file in the Build Directory.
分配的 layer 为你的分配版提供策略配置。最好的命令实践是你讲这些类型的配置文件划分为各自的 layer。你在 `conf/distro/ _`distro`_ .conf` 的设置会覆盖掉 BitBake 在 Build directory 中 `conf/local.conf` 找到的的相似的配置。

The following list provides some explanation and references for what you typically find in the distribution layer:
下面的列表提供了你通常能在分配 layer 中找到的解释和参考：

*   _classes:_  Class files (`.bbclass`) hold common functionality that can be shared among recipes in the distribution. When your recipes inherit a class, they take on the settings and functions for that class. You can read more about class files in the "[Classes][819]" section.
*   _classes:_	Class 文件（`.bbclass`）控制了在分配的 recipe 中可以共享使用的通用功能。当你的 recipe 继承了一个 class，它们会呈现这个 class 的设置和功能。你可以在 "[Classes][819]" 一节读到更多关于 class 文件的信息。


*   _conf:_  This area holds configuration files for the layer (`conf/layer.conf`), the distribution (`conf/distro/ _`distro`_ .conf`), and any distribution-wide include files.
*	_conf:_	 这部分控制了 layer（`conf/layer.conf`）的配置文件，distribution（`conf/distro _`distro`_ .conf`），和 distribution	范围内包含的文件。

*   _recipes-*:_  Recipes and append files that affect common functionality across the distribution. This area could include recipes and append files to add distribution-specific configuration, initialization scripts, custom image recipes, and so forth.
*	_recipes-*：_	Recipe 和 append 文件会在整个 distribution 过程中影响通用功能。这部分能包含 recipe 和 append 文件来添加和 distribution 相关的配置，初始化脚本，自定义镜像 recipe，以及类似的。

### 3.2.2. BSP Layer[¶][433]

The BSP Layer provides machine configurations. Everything in this layer is specific to the machine for which you are building the image or the SDK. A common structure or form is defined for BSP layers. You can learn more about this structure in the [Yocto Project Board Support Package (BSP) Developer's Guide][3771].
BSP layer 提供机器配置。在该 layer 的所有东西都是用于你要构建的镜像和 SDK 的机器。为 BSP layer 定义了一个共同的结构体。你可以在 [Yocto Project Board Support Package (BSP) Developer's Guide][3771] 获取关于这个结构体更多的信息。

### Note

In order for a BSP layer to be considered compliant with the Yocto Project, it must meet some structural requirements.
为了确保一个 BSP layer 和 Yocto 项目匹配，它必须满足依稀结构要求。

The BSP Layer's configuration directory contains configuration files for the machine (`conf/machine/ _`machine`_ .conf`) and, of course, the layer (`conf/layer.conf`).
BSP layer 的配置目录包含机器配置文件（`conf/machine/ _`machine`_ .conf`），以及，当然了还有 layer 配置文件（`conf/layer.conf`）。

The remainder of the layer is dedicated to specific recipes by function: `recipes-bsp`, `recipes-core`, `recipes-graphics`, and `recipes-kernel`. Metadata can exist for multiple formfactors, graphics support systems, and so forth.
剩下的 layer 是专门根据 recpie 功能的：`recipes-bsp`, `recipes-core`, `recipes-graphics`, 和 `recipes-kernel`。元数据存在于多个芯片封装，图形支持系统，以及类似的。

### Note

While the figure shows several `recipes-*` directories, not all these directories appear in all BSP layers.
虽然表格展示了几个 `recipes-*` 目录，但是并不是全部的目录都存在与 BSP layer。

### 3.2.3. 软件 Layer[¶][434]

The software layer provides the Metadata for additional software packages used during the build. This layer does not include Metadata that is specific to the distribution or the machine, which are found in their respective layers.
软件 layer 提供了构建过程中额外软件包的元数据。这个 layer 不包含和 distribution 或及其相关的元数据，这些都可以在他们对应的 layer 找到。

This layer contains any new recipes that your project needs in the form of recipe files.
这个 layer 以 recipe 文件格式提供了你的工程需要的所有新的 recipe。

### 3.3. 源[¶][820]

In order for the OpenEmbedded build system to create an image or any target, it must be able to access source files. The [general Yocto Project Development Environment figure][4186] represents source files using the "Upstream Project Releases", "Local Projects", and "SCMs (optional)" boxes. The figure represents mirrors, which also play a role in locating source files, with the "Source Mirror(s)" box.
为了让 OpenEmbedded 构建系统创建镜像或者任何目标，必须保证能够访问源文件。[general Yocto Project Development Environment figure][4186] 使用 “上游项目发布”，“本地项目”，和 “SCM（可选）”框展示了源文件。这个表格使用 “源镜像”框展示了参与定位源文件的镜像。

The method by which source files are ultimately organized is a function of the project. For example, for released software, projects tend to use tarballs or other archived files that can capture the state of a release guaranteeing that it is statically represented. On the other hand, for a project that is more dynamic or experimental in nature, a project might keep source files in a repository controlled by a Source Control Manager (SCM) such as Git. Pulling source from a repository allows you to control the point in the repository (the revision) from which you want to build software. Finally, a combination of the two might exist, which would give the consumer a choice when deciding where to get source files.
对源文件最根本的组织方法是按照项目的功能。举个例子，对于发布的软件，项目趋向于使用 tar 包或者其他可以捕获发布状态的压缩包，这样能保证它是静态展示的。另一方面，对于本质上更动态或者实验性质的项目，一个项目可能会使用源码管理器（SCM）的仓库来保存源文件，比如 git。从仓库拉取代码可能保证你控制你想要构建的软件的仓库版本。最后，这两种的组合也可能存在，这会让用户选择从哪里获取源代码。

BitBake uses the [`SRC_URI`][4187] variable to point to source files regardless of their location. Each recipe must have a `SRC_URI` variable that points to the source.
BitBake 使用变量 [`SRC_URI`][4187] 指向源文件而忽视他们的位置。每个 recipe 必须有一个 `SRC_URI` 变量指向源代码。

Another area that plays a significant role in where source files come from is pointed to by the [`DL_DIR`][4188] variable. This area is a cache that can hold previously downloaded source. You can also instruct the OpenEmbedded build system to create tarballs from Git repositories, which is not the default behavior, and store them in the `DL_DIR` by using the [`BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS`][4189] variable.
另一个在源文件中起重要角色的区域是由 [`DL_DIR`][4188]指向的。这个区域是之前下载下来的源代码的缓存。你可以命令 OpenEmbedded 构建系统从 Git 仓库创建压缩包，这并不是默认行为，然后通过变量 [`BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS`][4189] 把它们保存到 `DL_DIR` 目录。

Judicious use of a `DL_DIR` directory can save the build system a trip across the Internet when looking for files. A good method for using a download directory is to have `DL_DIR` point to an area outside of your Build Directory. Doing so allows you to safely delete the Build Directory if needed without fear of removing any downloaded source file.
明智的使用 `DL_DIR` 目录可以减少构建系统从网上搜寻文件的时间。使用下载目录的好行为是将 `DL_DIR` 指向 Build Directory 之外的区域。这样做可以让你安全地删除 Build Directory 而不需要害怕删除了已经下载了的源文件。

The remainder of this section provides a deeper look into the source files and the mirrors. Here is a more detailed look at the source file area of the base figure:
剩下的章节会深入观察源文件和镜像。这里是一个更详细基础表格的源码文件区域：

### 3.3.1. Upstream Project Releases[¶][435]

Upstream project releases exist anywhere in the form of an archived file (e.g. tarball or zip file). These files correspond to individual recipes. For example, the figure uses specific releases each for BusyBox, Qt, and Dbus. An archive file can be for any released product that can be built using a recipe.

### 3.3.2. Local Projects[¶][436]

Local projects are custom bits of software the user provides. These bits reside somewhere local to a project - perhaps a directory into which the user checks in items (e.g. a local directory containing a development source tree used by the group).

The canonical method through which to include a local project is to use the [`externalsrc`][3772] class to include that local project. You use either the `local.conf` or a recipe's append file to override or set the recipe to point to the local directory on your disk to pull in the whole source tree.

For information on how to use the `externalsrc` class, see the "[`externalsrc.bbclass`][3773]" section.

### 3.3.3. Source Control Managers (Optional)[¶][437]

Another place the build system can get source files from is through an SCM such as Git or Subversion. In this case, a repository is cloned or checked out. The [`do_fetch`][3774] task inside BitBake uses the [`SRC_URI`][3775] variable and the argument's prefix to determine the correct fetcher module.

### Note

For information on how to have the OpenEmbedded build system generate tarballs for Git repositories and place them in the [`DL_DIR`][3776]directory, see the [`BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS`][3777] variable.

When fetching a repository, BitBake uses the [`SRCREV`][3778] variable to determine the specific revision from which to build.

### 3.3.4. Source Mirror(s)[¶][438]

Two kinds of mirrors exist: pre-mirrors and regular mirrors. The [`PREMIRRORS`][3779] and [`MIRRORS`][3780] variables point to these, respectively. BitBake checks pre-mirrors before looking upstream for any source files. Pre-mirrors are appropriate when you have a shared directory that is not a directory defined by the [`DL_DIR`][3781] variable. A Pre-mirror typically points to a shared directory that is local to your organization.

Regular mirrors can be any site across the Internet that is used as an alternative location for source code should the primary site not be functioning for some reason or another.

### 3.4. Package Feeds[¶][821]

When the OpenEmbedded build system generates an image or an SDK, it gets the packages from a package feed area located in the [Build Directory][4190]. The [general Yocto Project Development Environment figure][4191] shows this package feeds area in the upper-right corner.

This section looks a little closer into the package feeds area used by the build system. Here is a more detailed look at the area:

| 
![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/package-feeds.png)
 |

Package feeds are an intermediary step in the build process. The OpenEmbedded build system provides classes to generate different package types, and you specify which classes to enable through the [`PACKAGE_CLASSES`][4192] variable. Before placing the packages into package feeds, the build process validates them with generated output quality assurance checks through the [`insane`][4193] class.

The package feed area resides in the Build Directory. The directory the build system uses to temporarily store packages is determined by a combination of variables and the particular package manager in use. See the "Package Feeds" box in the illustration and note the information to the right of that area. In particular, the following defines where package files are kept:

*   [`DEPLOY_DIR`][1839]: Defined as `tmp/deploy` in the Build Directory.

*   `DEPLOY_DIR_*`: Depending on the package manager used, the package type sub-folder. Given RPM, IPK, or DEB packaging and tarball creation, the[`DEPLOY_DIR_RPM`][1840], [`DEPLOY_DIR_IPK`][1841], [`DEPLOY_DIR_DEB`][1842], or [`DEPLOY_DIR_TAR`][1843], variables are used, respectively.

*   [`PACKAGE_ARCH`][1844]: Defines architecture-specific sub-folders. For example, packages could exist for the i586 or qemux86 architectures.

BitBake uses the `do_package_write_*` tasks to generate packages and place them into the package holding area (e.g. `do_package_write_ipk` for IPK packages). See the "[`do_package_write_deb`][4194]", "[`do_package_write_ipk`][4195]", "[`do_package_write_rpm`][4196]", and "[`do_package_write_tar`][4197]" sections for additional information. As an example, consider a scenario where an IPK packaging manager is being used and package architecture support for both i586 and qemux86 exist. Packages for the i586 architecture are placed in `build/tmp/deploy/ipk/i586`, while packages for the qemux86 architecture are placed in `build/tmp/deploy/ipk/qemux86`.

### 3.5. BitBake[¶][822]

The OpenEmbedded build system uses [BitBake][4198] to produce images. You can see from the [general Yocto Project Development Environment figure][4199], the BitBake area consists of several functional areas. This section takes a closer look at each of those areas.

Separate documentation exists for the BitBake tool. See the [BitBake User Manual][4200] for reference material on BitBake.

### 3.5.1. Source Fetching[¶][439]

The first stages of building a recipe are to fetch and unpack the source code:

| 
![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/source-fetching.png)
 |

The [`do_fetch`][3782] and [`do_unpack`][3783] tasks fetch the source files and unpack them into the work directory.

### Note

For every local file (e.g. `file://`) that is part of a recipe's [`SRC_URI`][3784] statement, the OpenEmbedded build system takes a checksum of the file for the recipe and inserts the checksum into the signature for the `do_fetch`. If any local file has been modified, the `do_fetch`task and all tasks that depend on it are re-executed.

By default, everything is accomplished in the [Build Directory][3785], which has a defined structure. For additional general information on the Build Directory, see the "[`build/`][3786]" section.

Unpacked source files are pointed to by the [`S`][3787] variable. Each recipe has an area in the Build Directory where the unpacked source code resides. The name of that directory for any given recipe is defined from several different variables. You can see the variables that define these directories by looking at the figure:

*   [`TMPDIR`][823] - The base directory where the OpenEmbedded build system performs all its work during the build.

*   [`PACKAGE_ARCH`][824] - The architecture of the built package or packages.

*   [`TARGET_OS`][825] - The operating system of the target device.

*   [`PN`][826] - The name of the built package.

*   [`PV`][827] - The version of the recipe used to build the package.

*   [`PR`][828] - The revision of the recipe used to build the package.

*   [`WORKDIR`][829] - The location within `TMPDIR` where a specific package is built.

*   [`S`][830] - Contains the unpacked source files for a given recipe.

### 3.5.2. Patching[¶][440]

Once source code is fetched and unpacked, BitBake locates patch files and applies them to the source files:

| 
![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/patching.png)
 |

The [`do_patch`][3788] task processes recipes by using the [`SRC_URI`][3789] variable to locate applicable patch files, which by default are `*.patch` or `*.diff` files, or any file if "apply=yes" is specified for the file in `SRC_URI`.

BitBake finds and applies multiple patches for a single recipe in the order in which it finds the patches. Patches are applied to the recipe's source files located in the [`S`][3790] directory.

For more information on how the source directories are created, see the "[Source Fetching][3791]" section.

### 3.5.3. Configuration and Compilation[¶][441]

After source code is patched, BitBake executes tasks that configure and compile the source code:

| 
![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/configuration-compile-autoreconf.png)
 |

This step in the build process consists of three tasks:

*   _[`do_prepare_recipe_sysroot`][29]:_  This task sets up the two sysroots in `${`[`WORKDIR`][831]`}` (i.e. `recipe-sysroot` and `recipe-sysroot-native`) so that the sysroots contain the contents of the [`do_populate_sysroot`][832] tasks of the recipes on which the recipe containing the tasks depends. A sysroot exists for both the target and for the native binaries, which run on the host system.

*   _`do_configure`:_  This task configures the source by enabling and disabling any build-time and configuration options for the software being built. Configurations can come from the recipe itself as well as from an inherited class. Additionally, the software itself might configure itself depending on the target for which it is being built.

    The configurations handled by the [`do_configure`][833] task are specific to source code configuration for the source code being built by the recipe.

    If you are using the [`autotools`][834] class, you can add additional configuration options by using the [`EXTRA_OECONF`][835] or [`PACKAGECONFIG_CONFARGS`][836]variables. For information on how this variable works within that class, see the `meta/classes/autotools.bbclass` file.

*   _`do_compile`:_  Once a configuration task has been satisfied, BitBake compiles the source using the [`do_compile`][837] task. Compilation occurs in the directory pointed to by the [`B`][838] variable. Realize that the `B` directory is, by default, the same as the [`S`][839] directory.

*   _`do_install`:_  Once compilation is done, BitBake executes the [`do_install`][840] task. This task copies files from the `B` directory and places them in a holding area pointed to by the [`D`][841] variable.

### 3.5.4. Package Splitting[¶][442]

After source code is configured and compiled, the OpenEmbedded build system analyzes the results and splits the output into packages:

| 
![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/analysis-for-package-splitting.png)
 |

The [`do_package`][3792] and [`do_packagedata`][3793] tasks combine to analyze the files found in the [`D`][3794] directory and split them into subsets based on available packages and files. The analyzing process involves the following as well as other items: splitting out debugging symbols, looking at shared library dependencies between packages, and looking at package relationships. The `do_packagedata` task creates package metadata based on the analysis such that the OpenEmbedded build system can generate the final packages. Working, staged, and intermediate results of the analysis and package splitting process use these areas:

*   [`PKGD`][842] - The destination directory for packages before they are split.

*   [`PKGDATA_DIR`][843] - A shared, global-state directory that holds data generated during the packaging process.

*   [`PKGDESTWORK`][844] - A temporary work area used by the `do_package` task.

*   [`PKGDEST`][845] - The parent directory for packages after they have been split.

The [`FILES`][3795] variable defines the files that go into each package in [`PACKAGES`][3796]. If you want details on how this is accomplished, you can look at the[`package`][3797] class.

Depending on the type of packages being created (RPM, DEB, or IPK), the `do_package_write_*` task creates the actual packages and places them in the Package Feed area, which is `${TMPDIR}/deploy`. You can see the "[Package Feeds][3798]" section for more detail on that part of the build process.

### Note

Support for creating feeds directly from the `deploy/*` directories does not exist. Creating such feeds usually requires some kind of feed maintenance mechanism that would upload the new packages into an official package feed (e.g. the Ångström distribution). This functionality is highly distribution-specific and thus is not provided out of the box.

### 3.5.5. Image Generation[¶][443]

Once packages are split and stored in the Package Feeds area, the OpenEmbedded build system uses BitBake to generate the root filesystem image:

| 
![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/image-generation.png)
 |

The image generation process consists of several stages and depends on several tasks and variables. The [`do_rootfs`][3799] task creates the root filesystem (file and directory structure) for an image. This task uses several key variables to help create the list of packages to actually install:

*   [`IMAGE_INSTALL`][846]: Lists out the base set of packages to install from the Package Feeds area.

*   [`PACKAGE_EXCLUDE`][847]: Specifies packages that should not be installed.

*   [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][848]: Specifies features to include in the image. Most of these features map to additional packages for installation.

*   [`PACKAGE_CLASSES`][849]: Specifies the package backend to use and consequently helps determine where to locate packages within the Package Feeds area.

*   [`IMAGE_LINGUAS`][850]: Determines the language(s) for which additional language support packages are installed.

*   [`PACKAGE_INSTALL`][851]: The final list of packages passed to the package manager for installation into the image.

With [`IMAGE_ROOTFS`][3800] pointing to the location of the filesystem under construction and the `PACKAGE_INSTALL` variable providing the final list of packages to install, the root file system is created.

Package installation is under control of the package manager (e.g. dnf/rpm, opkg, or apt/dpkg) regardless of whether or not package management is enabled for the target. At the end of the process, if package management is not enabled for the target, the package manager's data files are deleted from the root filesystem. As part of the final stage of package installation, postinstall scripts that are part of the packages are run. Any scripts that fail to run on the build host are run on the target when the target system is first booted. If you are using a [read-only root filesystem][3801], all the post installation scripts must succeed during the package installation phase since the root filesystem is read-only.

The final stages of the `do_rootfs` task handle post processing. Post processing includes creation of a manifest file and optimizations.

The manifest file (`.manifest`) resides in the same directory as the root filesystem image. This file lists out, line-by-line, the installed packages. The manifest file is useful for the [`testimage`][3802] class, for example, to determine whether or not to run specific tests. See the [`IMAGE_MANIFEST`][3803] variable for additional information.

Optimizing processes run across the image include `mklibs`, `prelink`, and any other post-processing commands as defined by the[`ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND`][3804] variable. The `mklibs` process optimizes the size of the libraries, while the `prelink` process optimizes the dynamic linking of shared libraries to reduce start up time of executables.

After the root filesystem is built, processing begins on the image through the `do_image` task. The build system runs any pre-processing commands as defined by the [`IMAGE_PREPROCESS_COMMAND`][3805] variable. This variable specifies a list of functions to call before the OpenEmbedded build system creates the final image output files.

The `do_image` task dynamically creates other `do_image_*` tasks as needed, which include compressing the root filesystem image to reduce the overall size of the image. The process turns everything into an image file or a set of image files. The formats used for the root filesystem depend on the[`IMAGE_FSTYPES`][3806] variable.

The final task involved in image creation is the `do_image_complete` task. This task completes the image by applying any image post processing as defined through the [`IMAGE_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND`][3807] variable. The variable specifies a list of functions to call once the OpenEmbedded build system has created the final image output files.

### Note

The entire image generation process is run under Pseudo. Running under Pseudo ensures that the files in the root filesystem have correct ownership.

### 3.5.6. SDK Generation[¶][444]

The OpenEmbedded build system uses BitBake to generate the Software Development Kit (SDK) installer script for both the standard and extensible SDKs: 
![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/sdk-generation.png)

### Note

For more information on the cross-development toolchain generation, see the "[Cross-Development Toolchain Generation][3808]" section. For information on advantages gained when building a cross-development toolchain using the [`do_populate_sdk`][3809] task, see the "[Building an SDK Installer][3810]" section in the Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK) Developer's Guide.

Like image generation, the SDK script process consists of several stages and depends on many variables. The `do_populate_sdk` and`do_populate_sdk_ext` tasks use these key variables to help create the list of packages to actually install. For information on the variables listed in the figure, see the "[Application Development SDK][3811]" section.

The `do_populate_sdk` task helps create the standard SDK and handles two parts: a target part and a host part. The target part is the part built for the target hardware and includes libraries and headers. The host part is the part of the SDK that runs on the [`SDKMACHINE`][3812].

The `do_populate_sdk_ext` task helps create the extensible SDK and handles host and target parts differently than its counter part does for the standard SDK. For the extensible SDK, the task encapsulates the build system, which includes everything needed (host and target) for the SDK.

Regardless of the type of SDK being constructed, the tasks perform some cleanup after which a cross-development environment setup script and any needed configuration files are created. The final output is the Cross-development toolchain installation script (`.sh` file), which includes the environment setup script.

### 3.5.7. Stamp Files and the Rerunning of Tasks[¶][445]

For each task that completes successfully, BitBake writes a stamp file into the [`STAMPS_DIR`][3813] directory. The beginning of the stamp file's filename is determined by the [`STAMP`][3814] variable, and the end of the name consists of the task's name and current [input checksum][3815].

### Note

This naming scheme assumes that [`BB_SIGNATURE_HANDLER`][3816] is "OEBasicHash", which is almost always the case in current OpenEmbedded.

To determine if a task needs to be rerun, BitBake checks if a stamp file with a matching input checksum exists for the task. If such a stamp file exists, the task's output is assumed to exist and still be valid. If the file does not exist, the task is rerun.

### Note

The stamp mechanism is more general than the shared state (sstate) cache mechanism described in the "[Setscene Tasks and Shared State][3456]" section. BitBake avoids rerunning any task that has a valid stamp file, not just tasks that can be accelerated through the sstate cache.

However, you should realize that stamp files only serve as a marker that some work has been done and that these files do not record task output. The actual task output would usually be somewhere in [`TMPDIR`][3457] (e.g. in some recipe's [`WORKDIR`][3458].) What the sstate cache mechanism adds is a way to cache task output that can then be shared between build machines.

Since `STAMPS_DIR` is usually a subdirectory of `TMPDIR`, removing `TMPDIR` will also remove `STAMPS_DIR`, which means tasks will properly be rerun to repopulate `TMPDIR`.

If you want some task to always be considered "out of date", you can mark it with the [`nostamp`][3817] varflag. If some other task depends on such a task, then that task will also always be considered out of date, which might not be what you want.

For details on how to view information about a task's signature, see the "[Viewing Task Variable Dependencies][3818]" section.

### 3.5.8. Setscene Tasks and Shared State[¶][446]

The description of tasks so far assumes that BitBake needs to build everything and there are no prebuilt objects available. BitBake does support skipping tasks if prebuilt objects are available. These objects are usually made available in the form of a shared state (sstate) cache.

### Note

For information on variables affecting sstate, see the [`SSTATE_DIR`][3819] and [`SSTATE_MIRRORS`][3820] variables.

The idea of a setscene task (i.e `do_` _`taskname`_ `_setscene`) is a version of the task where instead of building something, BitBake can skip to the end result and simply place a set of files into specific locations as needed. In some cases, it makes sense to have a setscene task variant (e.g. generating package files in the `do_package_write_*` task). In other cases, it does not make sense, (e.g. a [`do_patch`][3821] task or [`do_unpack`][3822] task) since the work involved would be equal to or greater than the underlying task.

In the OpenEmbedded build system, the common tasks that have setscene variants are [`do_package`][3823], `do_package_write_*`, [`do_deploy`][3824],[`do_packagedata`][3825], and [`do_populate_sysroot`][3826]. Notice that these are most of the tasks whose output is an end result.

The OpenEmbedded build system has knowledge of the relationship between these tasks and other tasks that precede them. For example, if BitBake runs `do_populate_sysroot_setscene` for something, there is little point in running any of the `do_fetch`, `do_unpack`, `do_patch`, `do_configure`,`do_compile`, and `do_install` tasks. However, if `do_package` needs to be run, BitBake would need to run those other tasks.

It becomes more complicated if everything can come from an sstate cache because some objects are simply not required at all. For example, you do not need a compiler or native tools, such as quilt, if there is nothing to compile or patch. If the `do_package_write_*` packages are available from sstate, BitBake does not need the `do_package` task data.

To handle all these complexities, BitBake runs in two phases. The first is the "setscene" stage. During this stage, BitBake first checks the sstate cache for any targets it is planning to build. BitBake does a fast check to see if the object exists rather than a complete download. If nothing exists, the second phase, which is the setscene stage, completes and the main build proceeds.

If objects are found in the sstate cache, the OpenEmbedded build system works backwards from the end targets specified by the user. For example, if an image is being built, the OpenEmbedded build system first looks for the packages needed for that image and the tools needed to construct an image. If those are available, the compiler is not needed. Thus, the compiler is not even downloaded. If something was found to be unavailable, or the download or setscene task fails, the OpenEmbedded build system then tries to install dependencies, such as the compiler, from the cache.

The availability of objects in the sstate cache is handled by the function specified by the [`BB_HASHCHECK_FUNCTION`][3827] variable and returns a list of the objects that are available. The function specified by the [`BB_SETSCENE_DEPVALID`][3828] variable is the function that determines whether a given dependency needs to be followed, and whether for any given relationship the function needs to be passed. The function returns a True or False value.

### 3.6. Images[¶][852]

The images produced by the OpenEmbedded build system are compressed forms of the root filesystem that are ready to boot on a target device. You can see from the [general Yocto Project Development Environment figure][4201] that BitBake output, in part, consists of images. This section is going to look more closely at this output:

| 
![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/images.png)
 |

For a list of example images that the Yocto Project provides, see the "[Images][4202]" chapter.

Images are written out to the [Build Directory][4203] inside the `tmp/deploy/images/ _`machine`_ /` folder as shown in the figure. This folder contains any files expected to be loaded on the target device. The [`DEPLOY_DIR`][4204] variable points to the `deploy` directory, while the [`DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE`][4205] variable points to the appropriate directory containing images for the current configuration.

*   `_`kernel-image`_` : A kernel binary file. The [`KERNEL_IMAGETYPE`][1845] variable setting determines the naming scheme for the kernel image file. Depending on that variable, the file could begin with a variety of naming strings. The `deploy/images/ _`machine`_`  directory can contain multiple image files for the machine.

*   `_`root-filesystem-image`_` : Root filesystems for the target device (e.g. `*.ext3` or `*.bz2` files). The [`IMAGE_FSTYPES`][1846] variable setting determines the root filesystem image type. The `deploy/images/ _`machine`_`  directory can contain multiple root filesystems for the machine.

*   `_`kernel-modules`_` : Tarballs that contain all the modules built for the kernel. Kernel module tarballs exist for legacy purposes and can be suppressed by setting the [`MODULE_TARBALL_DEPLOY`][1847] variable to "0". The `deploy/images/ _`machine`_`  directory can contain multiple kernel module tarballs for the machine.

*   `_`bootloaders`_` : Bootloaders supporting the image, if applicable to the target machine. The `deploy/images/ _`machine`_`  directory can contain multiple bootloaders for the machine.

*   `_`symlinks`_` : The `deploy/images/ _`machine`_`  folder contains a symbolic link that points to the most recently built file for each machine. These links might be useful for external scripts that need to obtain the latest version of each file.

### 3.7. Application Development SDK[¶][853]

In the [general Yocto Project Development Environment figure][4206], the output labeled "Application Development SDK" represents an SDK. The SDK generation process differs depending on whether you build a standard SDK (e.g. `bitbake -c populate_sdk`  _`imagename`_ ) or an extensible SDK (e.g. `bitbake -c populate_sdk_ext`  _`imagename`_ ). This section is going to take a closer look at this output:

| 
![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/sdk.png)
 |

The specific form of this output is a self-extracting SDK installer (`*.sh`) that, when run, installs the SDK, which consists of a cross-development toolchain, a set of libraries and headers, and an SDK environment setup script. Running this installer essentially sets up your cross-development environment. You can think of the cross-toolchain as the "host" part because it runs on the SDK machine. You can think of the libraries and headers as the "target" part because they are built for the target hardware. The environment setup script is added so that you can initialize the environment before using the tools.

### Note

The Yocto Project supports several methods by which you can set up this cross-development environment. These methods include downloading pre-built SDK installers or building and installing your own SDK installer.

For background information on cross-development toolchains in the Yocto Project development environment, see the "[Cross-Development Toolchain Generation][3829]" section. For information on setting up a cross-development environment, see the [Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK) Developer's Guide][3830].

Once built, the SDK installers are written out to the `deploy/sdk` folder inside the [Build Directory][4207] as shown in the figure at the beginning of this section. Depending on the type of SDK, several variables exist that help configure these files. The following list shows the variables associated with a standard SDK:

*   [`DEPLOY_DIR`][1848]: Points to the `deploy` directory.

*   [`SDKMACHINE`][1849]: Specifies the architecture of the machine on which the cross-development tools are run to create packages for the target hardware.

*   [`SDKIMAGE_FEATURES`][1850]: Lists the features to include in the "target" part of the SDK.

*   [`TOOLCHAIN_HOST_TASK`][1851]: Lists packages that make up the host part of the SDK (i.e. the part that runs on the `SDKMACHINE`). When you use `bitbake -c populate_sdk  _`imagename`_`  to create the SDK, a set of default packages apply. This variable allows you to add more packages.

*   [`TOOLCHAIN_TARGET_TASK`][1852]: Lists packages that make up the target part of the SDK (i.e. the part built for the target hardware).

*   [`SDKPATH`][1853]: Defines the default SDK installation path offered by the installation script.

This next list, shows the variables associated with an extensible SDK:

*   [`DEPLOY_DIR`][1854]: Points to the `deploy` directory.

*   [`SDK_EXT_TYPE`][1855]: Controls whether or not shared state artifacts are copied into the extensible SDK. By default, all required shared state artifacts are copied into the SDK.

*   [`SDK_INCLUDE_PKGDATA`][1856]: Specifies whether or not packagedata will be included in the extensible SDK for all recipes in the "world" target.

*   [`SDK_INCLUDE_TOOLCHAIN`][1857]: Specifies whether or not the toolchain will be included when building the extensible SDK.

*   [`SDK_LOCAL_CONF_WHITELIST`][1858]: A list of variables allowed through from the build system configuration into the extensible SDK configuration.

*   [`SDK_LOCAL_CONF_BLACKLIST`][1859]: A list of variables not allowed through from the build system configuration into the extensible SDK configuration.

*   [`SDK_INHERIT_BLACKLIST`][1860]: A list of classes to remove from the [`INHERIT`][1861] value globally within the extensible SDK configuration.

### Chapter 4. Technical Details[¶][1862]


This chapter provides technical details for various parts of the Yocto Project. Currently, topics include Yocto Project components, cross-toolchain generation, shared state (sstate) cache, x32, Wayland support, and Licenses.

### 4.1. Yocto Project Components[¶][870]

The [BitBake][4208] task executor together with various types of configuration files form the OpenEmbedded Core. This section overviews these components by describing their use and how they interact.

BitBake handles the parsing and execution of the data files. The data itself is of various types:

*   _Recipes:_  Provides details about particular pieces of software.

*   _Class Data:_  Abstracts common build information (e.g. how to build a Linux kernel).

*   _Configuration Data:_  Defines machine-specific settings, policy decisions, and so forth. Configuration data acts as the glue to bind everything together.

BitBake knows how to combine multiple data sources together and refers to each data source as a layer. For information on layers, see the "[Understanding and Creating Layers][4209]" section of the Yocto Project Development Manual.

Following are some brief details on these core components. For additional information on how these components interact during a build, see the "[A Closer Look at the Yocto Project Development Environment][4210]" Chapter.

### 4.1.1. BitBake[¶][447]

BitBake is the tool at the heart of the OpenEmbedded build system and is responsible for parsing the [Metadata][3831], generating a list of tasks from it, and then executing those tasks.

This section briefly introduces BitBake. If you want more information on BitBake, see the [BitBake User Manual][3832].

To see a list of the options BitBake supports, use either of the following commands:

```
     $ bitbake -h
     $ bitbake --help

```

The most common usage for BitBake is `bitbake  _`packagename`_` , where `packagename` is the name of the package you want to build (referred to as the "target" in this manual). The target often equates to the first part of a recipe's filename (e.g. "foo" for a recipe named `foo_1.3.0-r0.bb`). So, to process the `matchbox-desktop_1.2.3.bb` recipe file, you might type the following:

```
     $ bitbake matchbox-desktop

```

Several different versions of `matchbox-desktop` might exist. BitBake chooses the one selected by the distribution configuration. You can get more details about how BitBake chooses between different target versions and providers in the "[Preferences][3833]" section of the BitBake User Manual.

BitBake also tries to execute any dependent tasks first. So for example, before building `matchbox-desktop`, BitBake would build a cross compiler and `glibc` if they had not already been built.

A useful BitBake option to consider is the `-k` or `--continue` option. This option instructs BitBake to try and continue processing the job as long as possible even after encountering an error. When an error occurs, the target that failed and those that depend on it cannot be remade. However, when you use this option other dependencies can still be processed.

### 4.1.2. Metadata (Recipes)[¶][448]

Files that have the `.bb` suffix are "recipes" files. In general, a recipe contains information about a single piece of software. This information includes the location from which to download the unaltered source, any source patches to be applied to that source (if needed), which special configuration options to apply, how to compile the source files, and how to package the compiled output.

The term "package" is sometimes used to refer to recipes. However, since the word "package" is used for the packaged output from the OpenEmbedded build system (i.e. `.ipk` or `.deb` files), this document avoids using the term "package" when referring to recipes.

### 4.1.3. Classes[¶][449]

Class files (`.bbclass`) contain information that is useful to share between [Metadata][3834] files. An example is the [`autotools`][3835] class, which contains common settings for any application that Autotools uses. The "[Classes][3836]" chapter provides details about classes and how to use them.

### 4.1.4. Configuration[¶][450]

The configuration files (`.conf`) define various configuration variables that govern the OpenEmbedded build process. These files fall into several areas that define machine configuration options, distribution configuration options, compiler tuning options, general common configuration options, and user configuration options in `local.conf`, which is found in the [Build Directory][3837].

### 4.2. Cross-Development Toolchain Generation[¶][871]

The Yocto Project does most of the work for you when it comes to creating [cross-development toolchains][4211]. This section provides some technical background on how cross-development toolchains are created and used. For more information on toolchains, you can also see the [Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK) Developer's Guide][4212].

In the Yocto Project development environment, cross-development toolchains are used to build the image and applications that run on the target hardware. With just a few commands, the OpenEmbedded build system creates these necessary toolchains for you.

The following figure shows a high-level build environment regarding toolchain construction and use.

| 
![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/cross-development-toolchains.png)
 |

Most of the work occurs on the Build Host. This is the machine used to build images and generally work within the the Yocto Project environment. When you run BitBake to create an image, the OpenEmbedded build system uses the host `gcc` compiler to bootstrap a cross-compiler named `gcc-cross`. The `gcc-cross` compiler is what BitBake uses to compile source files when creating the target image. You can think of `gcc-cross` simply as an automatically generated cross-compiler that is used internally within BitBake only.

### Note

The extensible SDK does not use `gcc-cross-canadian` since this SDK ships a copy of the OpenEmbedded build system and the sysroot within it contains `gcc-cross`.

The chain of events that occurs when `gcc-cross` is bootstrapped is as follows:

```
     gcc -> binutils-cross -> gcc-cross-initial -> linux-libc-headers -> glibc-initial -> glibc -> gcc-cross -> gcc-runtime

```

*   `gcc`: The build host's GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

*   `binutils-cross`: The bare minimum binary utilities needed in order to run the `gcc-cross-initial` phase of the bootstrap operation.

*   `gcc-cross-initial`: An early stage of the bootstrap process for creating the cross-compiler. This stage builds enough of the `gcc-cross`, the C library, and other pieces needed to finish building the final cross-compiler in later stages. This tool is a "native" package (i.e. it is designed to run on the build host).

*   `linux-libc-headers`: Headers needed for the cross-compiler.

*   `glibc-initial`: An initial version of the Embedded GLIBC needed to bootstrap `glibc`.

*   `gcc-cross`: The final stage of the bootstrap process for the cross-compiler. This stage results in the actual cross-compiler that BitBake uses when it builds an image for a targeted device.

    ### Note

    If you are replacing this cross compiler toolchain with a custom version, you must replace `gcc-cross`.

    This tool is also a "native" package (i.e. it is designed to run on the build host).

*   `gcc-runtime`: Runtime libraries resulting from the toolchain bootstrapping process. This tool produces a binary that consists of the runtime libraries need for the targeted device.

You can use the OpenEmbedded build system to build an installer for the relocatable SDK used to develop applications. When you run the installer, it installs the toolchain, which contains the development tools (e.g., the `gcc-cross-canadian`), `binutils-cross-canadian`, and other `nativesdk-*`tools, which are tools native to the SDK (i.e. native to [`SDK_ARCH`][4213]), you need to cross-compile and test your software. The figure shows the commands you use to easily build out this toolchain. This cross-development toolchain is built to execute on the [`SDKMACHINE`][4214], which might or might not be the same machine as the Build Host.

### Note

If your target architecture is supported by the Yocto Project, you can take advantage of pre-built images that ship with the Yocto Project and already contain cross-development toolchain installers.

Here is the bootstrap process for the relocatable toolchain:

```
     gcc -> binutils-crosssdk -> gcc-crosssdk-initial -> linux-libc-headers ->
        glibc-initial -> nativesdk-glibc -> gcc-crosssdk -> gcc-cross-canadian

```

*   `gcc`: The build host's GNU Compiler Collection (GCC).

*   `binutils-crosssdk`: The bare minimum binary utilities needed in order to run the `gcc-crosssdk-initial` phase of the bootstrap operation.

*   `gcc-crosssdk-initial`: An early stage of the bootstrap process for creating the cross-compiler. This stage builds enough of the `gcc-crosssdk` and supporting pieces so that the final stage of the bootstrap process can produce the finished cross-compiler. This tool is a "native" binary that runs on the build host.

*   `linux-libc-headers`: Headers needed for the cross-compiler.

*   `glibc-initial`: An initial version of the Embedded GLIBC needed to bootstrap `nativesdk-glibc`.

*   `nativesdk-glibc`: The Embedded GLIBC needed to bootstrap the `gcc-crosssdk`.

*   `gcc-crosssdk`: The final stage of the bootstrap process for the relocatable cross-compiler. The `gcc-crosssdk` is a transitory compiler and never leaves the build host. Its purpose is to help in the bootstrap process to create the eventual relocatable `gcc-cross-canadian` compiler, which is relocatable. This tool is also a "native" package (i.e. it is designed to run on the build host).

*   `gcc-cross-canadian`: The final relocatable cross-compiler. When run on the [`SDKMACHINE`][1863], this tool produces executable code that runs on the target device. Only one cross-canadian compiler is produced per architecture since they can be targeted at different processor optimizations using configurations passed to the compiler through the compile commands. This circumvents the need for multiple compilers and thus reduces the size of the toolchains.

### 4.3. Shared State Cache[¶][872]

By design, the OpenEmbedded build system builds everything from scratch unless BitBake can determine that parts do not need to be rebuilt. Fundamentally, building from scratch is attractive as it means all parts are built fresh and there is no possibility of stale data causing problems. When developers hit problems, they typically default back to building from scratch so they know the state of things from the start.

Building an image from scratch is both an advantage and a disadvantage to the process. As mentioned in the previous paragraph, building from scratch ensures that everything is current and starts from a known state. However, building from scratch also takes much longer as it generally means rebuilding things that do not necessarily need to be rebuilt.

The Yocto Project implements shared state code that supports incremental builds. The implementation of the shared state code answers the following questions that were fundamental roadblocks within the OpenEmbedded incremental build support system:

*   What pieces of the system have changed and what pieces have not changed?

*   How are changed pieces of software removed and replaced?

*   How are pre-built components that do not need to be rebuilt from scratch used when they are available?

For the first question, the build system detects changes in the "inputs" to a given task by creating a checksum (or signature) of the task's inputs. If the checksum changes, the system assumes the inputs have changed and the task needs to be rerun. For the second question, the shared state (sstate) code tracks which tasks add which output to the build process. This means the output from a given task can be removed, upgraded or otherwise manipulated. The third question is partly addressed by the solution for the second question assuming the build system can fetch the sstate objects from remote locations and install them if they are deemed to be valid.

### Note

The OpenEmbedded build system does not maintain [`PR`][4216] information as part of the shared state packages. Consequently, considerations exist that affect maintaining shared state feeds. For information on how the OpenEmbedded build system works with packages and can track incrementing `PR` information, see the "[Automatically Incrementing a Binary Package Revision Number][4217]" section.

The rest of this section goes into detail about the overall incremental build architecture, the checksums (signatures), shared state, and some tips and tricks.

### 4.3.1. Overall Architecture[¶][451]

When determining what parts of the system need to be built, BitBake works on a per-task basis rather than a per-recipe basis. You might wonder why using a per-task basis is preferred over a per-recipe basis. To help explain, consider having the IPK packaging backend enabled and then switching to DEB. In this case, the [`do_install`][3838] and [`do_package`][3839] task outputs are still valid. However, with a per-recipe approach, the build would not include the`.deb` files. Consequently, you would have to invalidate the whole build and rerun it. Rerunning everything is not the best solution. Also, in this case, the core must be "taught" much about specific tasks. This methodology does not scale well and does not allow users to easily add new tasks in layers or as external recipes without touching the packaged-staging core.

### 4.3.2. Checksums (Signatures)[¶][452]

The shared state code uses a checksum, which is a unique signature of a task's inputs, to determine if a task needs to be run again. Because it is a change in a task's inputs that triggers a rerun, the process needs to detect all the inputs to a given task. For shell tasks, this turns out to be fairly easy because the build process generates a "run" shell script for each task and it is possible to create a checksum that gives you a good idea of when the task's data changes.

To complicate the problem, there are things that should not be included in the checksum. First, there is the actual specific build path of a given task - the [`WORKDIR`][3840]. It does not matter if the work directory changes because it should not affect the output for target packages. Also, the build process has the objective of making native or cross packages relocatable.

### Note

Both native and cross packages run on the build host. However, cross packages generate output for the target architecture.

The checksum therefore needs to exclude `WORKDIR`. The simplistic approach for excluding the work directory is to set `WORKDIR` to some fixed value and create the checksum for the "run" script.

Another problem results from the "run" scripts containing functions that might or might not get called. The incremental build solution contains code that figures out dependencies between shell functions. This code is used to prune the "run" scripts down to the minimum set, thereby alleviating this problem and making the "run" scripts much more readable as a bonus.

So far we have solutions for shell scripts. What about Python tasks? The same approach applies even though these tasks are more difficult. The process needs to figure out what variables a Python function accesses and what functions it calls. Again, the incremental build solution contains code that first figures out the variable and function dependencies, and then creates a checksum for the data used as the input to the task.

Like the `WORKDIR` case, situations exist where dependencies should be ignored. For these cases, you can instruct the build process to ignore a dependency by using a line like the following:

```
     PACKAGE_ARCHS[vardepsexclude] = "MACHINE"

```

This example ensures that the [`PACKAGE_ARCHS`][3841] variable does not depend on the value of [`MACHINE`][3842], even if it does reference it.

Equally, there are cases where we need to add dependencies BitBake is not able to find. You can accomplish this by using a line like the following:

```
      PACKAGE_ARCHS[vardeps] = "MACHINE"

```

This example explicitly adds the `MACHINE` variable as a dependency for `PACKAGE_ARCHS`.

Consider a case with in-line Python, for example, where BitBake is not able to figure out dependencies. When running in debug mode (i.e. using `-DDD`), BitBake produces output when it discovers something for which it cannot figure out dependencies. The Yocto Project team has currently not managed to cover those dependencies in detail and is aware of the need to fix this situation.

Thus far, this section has limited discussion to the direct inputs into a task. Information based on direct inputs is referred to as the "basehash" in the code. However, there is still the question of a task's indirect inputs - the things that were already built and present in the [Build Directory][3843]. The checksum (or signature) for a particular task needs to add the hashes of all the tasks on which the particular task depends. Choosing which dependencies to add is a policy decision. However, the effect is to generate a master checksum that combines the basehash and the hashes of the task's dependencies.

At the code level, there are a variety of ways both the basehash and the dependent task hashes can be influenced. Within the BitBake configuration file, we can give BitBake some extra information to help it construct the basehash. The following statement effectively results in a list of global variable dependency excludes - variables never included in any checksum:

```
     BB_HASHBASE_WHITELIST ?= "TMPDIR FILE PATH PWD BB_TASKHASH BBPATH DL_DIR \
         SSTATE_DIR THISDIR FILESEXTRAPATHS FILE_DIRNAME HOME LOGNAME SHELL TERM \
         USER FILESPATH STAGING_DIR_HOST STAGING_DIR_TARGET COREBASE PRSERV_HOST \
         PRSERV_DUMPDIR PRSERV_DUMPFILE PRSERV_LOCKDOWN PARALLEL_MAKE \
         CCACHE_DIR EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN CCACHE CCACHE_DISABLE LICENSE_PATH SDKPKGSUFFIX"

```

The previous example excludes [`WORKDIR`][3844] since that variable is actually constructed as a path within [`TMPDIR`][3845], which is on the whitelist.

The rules for deciding which hashes of dependent tasks to include through dependency chains are more complex and are generally accomplished with a Python function. The code in `meta/lib/oe/sstatesig.py` shows two examples of this and also illustrates how you can insert your own policy into the system if so desired. This file defines the two basic signature generators `OE-Core` uses: "OEBasic" and "OEBasicHash". By default, there is a dummy "noop" signature handler enabled in BitBake. This means that behavior is unchanged from previous versions. `OE-Core` uses the "OEBasicHash" signature handler by default through this setting in the `bitbake.conf` file:

```
     BB_SIGNATURE_HANDLER ?= "OEBasicHash"

```

The "OEBasicHash" `BB_SIGNATURE_HANDLER` is the same as the "OEBasic" version but adds the task hash to the stamp files. This results in any[Metadata][3846] change that changes the task hash, automatically causing the task to be run again. This removes the need to bump [`PR`][3847] values, and changes to Metadata automatically ripple across the build.

It is also worth noting that the end result of these signature generators is to make some dependency and hash information available to the build. This information includes:

*   `BB_BASEHASH_task-` _`taskname`_ : The base hashes for each task in the recipe.

*   `BB_BASEHASH_` _`filename`_ `:` _`taskname`_ : The base hashes for each dependent task.

*   `BBHASHDEPS_` _`filename`_ `:` _`taskname`_ : The task dependencies for each task.

*   `BB_TASKHASH`: The hash of the currently running task.

### 4.3.3. Shared State[¶][453]

Checksums and dependencies, as discussed in the previous section, solve half the problem of supporting a shared state. The other part of the problem is being able to use checksum information during the build and being able to reuse or rebuild specific components.

The [`sstate`][3848] class is a relatively generic implementation of how to "capture" a snapshot of a given task. The idea is that the build process does not care about the source of a task's output. Output could be freshly built or it could be downloaded and unpacked from somewhere - the build process does not need to worry about its origin.

There are two types of output, one is just about creating a directory in [`WORKDIR`][3849]. A good example is the output of either [`do_install`][3850] or [`do_package`][3851]. The other type of output occurs when a set of data is merged into a shared directory tree such as the sysroot.

The Yocto Project team has tried to keep the details of the implementation hidden in `sstate` class. From a user's perspective, adding shared state wrapping to a task is as simple as this [`do_deploy`][3852] example taken from the [`deploy`][3853] class:

```
     DEPLOYDIR = "${WORKDIR}/deploy-${PN}"
     SSTATETASKS += "do_deploy"
     do_deploy[sstate-inputdirs] = "${DEPLOYDIR}"
     do_deploy[sstate-outputdirs] = "${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}"

     python do_deploy_setscene () {
         sstate_setscene(d)
     }
     addtask do_deploy_setscene
     do_deploy[dirs] = "${DEPLOYDIR} ${B}"

```

The following list explains the previous example:

*   Adding "do_deploy" to `SSTATETASKS` adds some required sstate-related processing, which is implemented in the [`sstate`][873] class, to before and after the [`do_deploy`][874] task.

*   The `do_deploy[sstate-inputdirs] = "${DEPLOYDIR}"` declares that `do_deploy` places its output in `${DEPLOYDIR}` when run normally (i.e. when not using the sstate cache). This output becomes the input to the shared state cache.

*   The `do_deploy[sstate-outputdirs] = "${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}"` line causes the contents of the shared state cache to be copied to `${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}`.

    ### Note

    If `do_deploy` is not already in the shared state cache or if its input checksum (signature) has changed from when the output was cached, the task will be run to populate the shared state cache, after which the contents of the shared state cache is copied to`${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}`. If `do_deploy` is in the shared state cache and its signature indicates that the cached output is still valid (i.e. if no relevant task inputs have changed), then the contents of the shared state cache will be copied directly to`${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}` by the `do_deploy_setscene` task instead, skipping the `do_deploy` task.

*   The following task definition is glue logic needed to make the previous settings effective:

    ```
         python do_deploy_setscene () {
             sstate_setscene(d)
         }
         addtask do_deploy_setscene

    ```

    `sstate_setscene()` takes the flags above as input and accelerates the `do_deploy` task through the shared state cache if possible. If the task was accelerated, `sstate_setscene()` returns True. Otherwise, it returns False, and the normal `do_deploy` task runs. For more information, see the "[setscene][875]" section in the BitBake User Manual.

*   The `do_deploy[dirs] = "${DEPLOYDIR} ${B}"` line creates `${DEPLOYDIR}` and `${B}` before the `do_deploy` task runs, and also sets the current working directory of `do_deploy` to `${B}`. For more information, see the "[Variable Flags][876]" section in the BitBake User Manual.

    ### Note

    In cases where `sstate-inputdirs` and `sstate-outputdirs` would be the same, you can use `sstate-plaindirs`. For example, to preserve the `${PKGD}` and `${PKGDEST}` output from the [`do_package`][877] task, use the following:
    ```
         do_package[sstate-plaindirs] = "${PKGD} ${PKGDEST}"

    ```

*   `sstate-inputdirs` and `sstate-outputdirs` can also be used with multiple directories. For example, the following declares `PKGDESTWORK` and`SHLIBWORK` as shared state input directories, which populates the shared state cache, and `PKGDATA_DIR` and `SHLIBSDIR` as the corresponding shared state output directories:

    ```
         do_package[sstate-inputdirs] = "${PKGDESTWORK} ${SHLIBSWORKDIR}"
         do_package[sstate-outputdirs] = "${PKGDATA_DIR} ${SHLIBSDIR}"

    ```

*   These methods also include the ability to take a lockfile when manipulating shared state directory structures, for cases where file additions or removals are sensitive:

    ```
         do_package[sstate-lockfile] = "${PACKAGELOCK}"

    ```

Behind the scenes, the shared state code works by looking in [`SSTATE_DIR`][3854] and [`SSTATE_MIRRORS`][3855] for shared state files. Here is an example:

```
     SSTATE_MIRRORS ?= "\
     file://.* http://someserver.tld/share/sstate/PATH;downloadfilename=PATH \n \
     file://.* file:///some/local/dir/sstate/PATH"

```

### Note

The shared state directory (`SSTATE_DIR`) is organized into two-character subdirectories, where the subdirectory names are based on the first two characters of the hash. If the shared state directory structure for a mirror has the same structure as `SSTATE_DIR`, you must specify "PATH" as part of the URI to enable the build system to map to the appropriate subdirectory.

The shared state package validity can be detected just by looking at the filename since the filename contains the task checksum (or signature) as described earlier in this section. If a valid shared state package is found, the build process downloads it and uses it to accelerate the task.

The build processes use the `*_setscene` tasks for the task acceleration phase. BitBake goes through this phase before the main execution code and tries to accelerate any tasks for which it can find shared state packages. If a shared state package for a task is available, the shared state package is used. This means the task and any tasks on which it is dependent are not executed.

As a real world example, the aim is when building an IPK-based image, only the [`do_package_write_ipk`][3856] tasks would have their shared state packages fetched and extracted. Since the sysroot is not used, it would never get extracted. This is another reason why a task-based approach is preferred over a recipe-based approach, which would have to install the output from every task.

### 4.3.4. Tips and Tricks[¶][454]

The code in the build system that supports incremental builds is not simple code. This section presents some tips and tricks that help you work around issues related to shared state code.

#### 4.3.4.1. Debugging[¶][30]

Seeing what metadata went into creating the input signature of a shared state (sstate) task can be a useful debugging aid. This information is available in signature information (`siginfo`) files in [`SSTATE_DIR`][3467]. For information on how to view and interpret information in `siginfo` files, see the "[Viewing Task Variable Dependencies][3468]" section.

#### 4.3.4.2. Invalidating Shared State[¶][31]

The OpenEmbedded build system uses checksums and shared state cache to avoid unnecessarily rebuilding tasks. Collectively, this scheme is known as "shared state code."

As with all schemes, this one has some drawbacks. It is possible that you could make implicit changes to your code that the checksum calculations do not take into account. These implicit changes affect a task's output but do not trigger the shared state code into rebuilding a recipe. Consider an example during which a tool changes its output. Assume that the output of `rpmdeps` changes. The result of the change should be that all the `package`and `package_write_rpm` shared state cache items become invalid. However, because the change to the output is external to the code and therefore implicit, the associated shared state cache items do not become invalidated. In this case, the build process uses the cached items rather than running the task again. Obviously, these types of implicit changes can cause problems.

To avoid these problems during the build, you need to understand the effects of any changes you make. Realize that changes you make directly to a function are automatically factored into the checksum calculation. Thus, these explicit changes invalidate the associated area of shared state cache. However, you need to be aware of any implicit changes that are not obvious changes to the code and could affect the output of a given task.

When you identify an implicit change, you can easily take steps to invalidate the cache and force the tasks to run. The steps you can take are as simple as changing a function's comments in the source code. For example, to invalidate package shared state files, change the comment statements of [`do_package`][3469] or the comments of one of the functions it calls. Even though the change is purely cosmetic, it causes the checksum to be recalculated and forces the OpenEmbedded build system to run the task again.

### Note

For an example of a commit that makes a cosmetic change to invalidate shared state, see this [commit][3470].

### 4.4. Automatically Added Runtime Dependencies[¶][878]

The OpenEmbedded build system automatically adds common types of runtime dependencies between packages, which means that you do not need to explicitly declare the packages using [`RDEPENDS`][4218]. Three automatic mechanisms exist (`shlibdeps`, `pcdeps`, and `depchains`) that handle shared libraries, package configuration (pkg-config) modules, and `-dev` and `-dbg` packages, respectively. For other types of runtime dependencies, you must manually declare the dependencies.

*   `shlibdeps`: During the [`do_package`][1864] task of each recipe, all shared libraries installed by the recipe are located. For each shared library, the package that contains the shared library is registered as providing the shared library. More specifically, the package is registered as providing the [soname][1865] of the library. The resulting shared-library-to-package mapping is saved globally in [`PKGDATA_DIR`][1866] by the [`do_packagedata`][1867] task.

    Simultaneously, all executables and shared libraries installed by the recipe are inspected to see what shared libraries they link against. For each shared library dependency that is found, `PKGDATA_DIR` is queried to see if some package (likely from a different recipe) contains the shared library. If such a package is found, a runtime dependency is added from the package that depends on the shared library to the package that contains the library.

    The automatically added runtime dependency also includes a version restriction. This version restriction specifies that at least the current version of the package that provides the shared library must be used, as if " _`package`_  (>=  _`version`_ )" had been added to [`RDEPENDS`][1868]. This forces an upgrade of the package containing the shared library when installing the package that depends on the library, if needed.

    If you want to avoid a package being registered as providing a particular shared library (e.g. because the library is for internal use only), then add the library to [`PRIVATE_LIBS`][1869] inside the package's recipe.

*   `pcdeps`: During the [`do_package`][1870] task of each recipe, all pkg-config modules (`*.pc` files) installed by the recipe are located. For each module, the package that contains the module is registered as providing the module. The resulting module-to-package mapping is saved globally in[`PKGDATA_DIR`][1871] by the [`do_packagedata`][1872] task.

    Simultaneously, all pkg-config modules installed by the recipe are inspected to see what other pkg-config modules they depend on. A module is seen as depending on another module if it contains a "Requires:" line that specifies the other module. For each module dependency, `PKGDATA_DIR` is queried to see if some package contains the module. If such a package is found, a runtime dependency is added from the package that depends on the module to the package that contains the module.

    ### Note

    The `pcdeps` mechanism most often infers dependencies between `-dev` packages.

*   `depchains`: If a package `foo` depends on a package `bar`, then `foo-dev` and `foo-dbg` are also made to depend on `bar-dev` and `bar-dbg`, respectively. Taking the `-dev` packages as an example, the `bar-dev` package might provide headers and shared library symlinks needed by `foo-dev`, which shows the need for a dependency between the packages.

    The dependencies added by `depchains` are in the form of [`RRECOMMENDS`][1873].

    ### Note

    By default, `foo-dev` also has an `RDEPENDS`-style dependency on `foo`, because the default value of `RDEPENDS_${PN}-dev` (set in`bitbake.conf`) includes "${PN}".

    To ensure that the dependency chain is never broken, `-dev` and `-dbg` packages are always generated by default, even if the packages turn out to be empty. See the [`ALLOW_EMPTY`][1874] variable for more information.

The `do_package` task depends on the [`do_packagedata`][4219] task of each recipe in [`DEPENDS`][4220] through use of a `[`[`deptask`][4221]`]` declaration, which guarantees that the required shared-library/module-to-package mapping information will be available when needed as long as `DEPENDS` has been correctly set.

### 4.5. Fakeroot and Pseudo[¶][879]

Some tasks are easier to implement when allowed to perform certain operations that are normally reserved for the root user. For example, the[`do_install`][4222] task benefits from being able to set the UID and GID of installed files to arbitrary values.

One approach to allowing tasks to perform root-only operations would be to require BitBake to run as root. However, this method is cumbersome and has security issues. The approach that is actually used is to run tasks that benefit from root privileges in a "fake" root environment. Within this environment, the task and its child processes believe that they are running as the root user, and see an internally consistent view of the filesystem. As long as generating the final output (e.g. a package or an image) does not require root privileges, the fact that some earlier steps ran in a fake root environment does not cause problems.

The capability to run tasks in a fake root environment is known as "fakeroot", which is derived from the BitBake keyword/variable flag that requests a fake root environment for a task. In current versions of the OpenEmbedded build system, the program that implements fakeroot is known as Pseudo.

Pseudo overrides system calls through the `LD_PRELOAD` mechanism to give the illusion of running as root. To keep track of "fake" file ownership and permissions resulting from operations that require root permissions, an sqlite3 database is used. This database is stored in`${`[`WORKDIR`][4223]`}/pseudo/files.db` for individual recipes. Storing the database in a file as opposed to in memory gives persistence between tasks, and even between builds.

### Caution

If you add your own task that manipulates the same files or directories as a fakeroot task, then that task should also run under fakeroot. Otherwise, the task will not be able to run root-only operations, and will not see the fake file ownership and permissions set by the other task. You should also add a dependency on `virtual/fakeroot-native:do_populate_sysroot`, giving the following:
```
       fakeroot do_mytask () {
           ...
       }
       do_mytask[depends] += "virtual/fakeroot-native:do_populate_sysroot"

```

For more information, see the [`FAKEROOT*`][4224] variables in the BitBake User Manual. You can also reference this [Pseudo][4225] article.

### 4.6. x32[¶][880]

x32 is a processor-specific Application Binary Interface (psABI) for x86_64\. An ABI defines the calling conventions between functions in a processing environment. The interface determines what registers are used and what the sizes are for various C data types.

Some processing environments prefer using 32-bit applications even when running on Intel 64-bit platforms. Consider the i386 psABI, which is a very old 32-bit ABI for Intel 64-bit platforms. The i386 psABI does not provide efficient use and access of the Intel 64-bit processor resources, leaving the system underutilized. Now consider the x86_64 psABI. This ABI is newer and uses 64-bits for data sizes and program pointers. The extra bits increase the footprint size of the programs, libraries, and also increases the memory and file system size requirements. Executing under the x32 psABI enables user programs to utilize CPU and system resources more efficiently while keeping the memory footprint of the applications low. Extra bits are used for registers but not for addressing mechanisms.

### 4.6.1. Support[¶][455]

This Yocto Project release supports the final specifications of x32 psABI. Support for x32 psABI exists as follows:

*   You can create packages and images in x32 psABI format on x86_64 architecture targets.

*   You can successfully build many recipes with the x32 toolchain.

*   You can create and boot `core-image-minimal` and `core-image-sato` images.

### 4.6.2. Completing x32[¶][456]

Future Plans for the x32 psABI in the Yocto Project include the following:

*   Enhance and fix the few remaining recipes so they work with and support x32 toolchains.

*   Enhance RPM Package Manager (RPM) support for x32 binaries.

*   Support larger images.

### 4.6.3. Using x32 Right Now[¶][457]

Follow these steps to use the x32 spABI:

*   Enable the x32 psABI tuning file for `x86_64` machines by editing the `conf/local.conf` like this:

    ```
          MACHINE = "qemux86-64"
          DEFAULTTUNE = "x86-64-x32"
          baselib = "${@d.getVar('BASE_LIB_tune-' + (d.getVar('DEFAULTTUNE', True) \
             or 'INVALID'), True) or 'lib'}"
          #MACHINE = "genericx86"
          #DEFAULTTUNE = "core2-64-x32"

    ```

*   As usual, use BitBake to build an image that supports the x32 psABI. Here is an example:

    ```
         $ bitbake core-image-sato

    ```

*   As usual, run your image using QEMU:

    ```
         $ runqemu qemux86-64 core-image-sato

    ```

### 4.7. Wayland[¶][881]

[Wayland][4226] is a computer display server protocol that provides a method for compositing window managers to communicate directly with applications and video hardware and expects them to communicate with input hardware using other libraries. Using Wayland with supporting targets can result in better control over graphics frame rendering than an application might otherwise achieve.

The Yocto Project provides the Wayland protocol libraries and the reference [Weston][4227] compositor as part of its release. This section describes what you need to do to implement Wayland and use the compositor when building an image for a supporting target.

### 4.7.1. Support[¶][458]

The Wayland protocol libraries and the reference Weston compositor ship as integrated packages in the `meta` layer of the [Source Directory][3857]. Specifically, you can find the recipes that build both Wayland and Weston at `meta/recipes-graphics/wayland`.

You can build both the Wayland and Weston packages for use only with targets that accept the [Mesa 3D and Direct Rendering Infrastructure][3858], which is also known as Mesa DRI. This implies that you cannot build and use the packages if your target uses, for example, the Intel® Embedded Media and Graphics Driver (Intel® EMGD) that overrides Mesa DRI.

### Note

Due to lack of EGL support, Weston 1.0.3 will not run directly on the emulated QEMU hardware. However, this version of Weston will run under X emulation without issues.

### 4.7.2. Enabling Wayland in an Image[¶][459]

To enable Wayland, you need to enable it to be built and enable it to be included in the image.

#### 4.7.2.1. Building[¶][32]

To cause Mesa to build the `wayland-egl` platform and Weston to build Wayland with Kernel Mode Setting ([KMS][3471]) support, include the "wayland" flag in the [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][3472] statement in your `local.conf` file:

```
     DISTRO_FEATURES_append = " wayland"

```

### Note

If X11 has been enabled elsewhere, Weston will build Wayland with X11 support

#### 4.7.2.2. Installing[¶][33]

To install the Wayland feature into an image, you must include the following [`CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL`][3473] statement in your `local.conf` file:

```
     CORE_IMAGE_EXTRA_INSTALL += "wayland weston"

```

### 4.7.3. Running Weston[¶][460]

To run Weston inside X11, enabling it as described earlier and building a Sato image is sufficient. If you are running your image under Sato, a Weston Launcher appears in the "Utility" category.

Alternatively, you can run Weston through the command-line interpretor (CLI), which is better suited for development work. To run Weston under the CLI, you need to do the following after your image is built:

1.  Run these commands to export `XDG_RUNTIME_DIR`:

    ```
         mkdir -p /tmp/$USER-weston
         chmod 0700 /tmp/$USER-weston
         export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp/$USER-weston

    ```

2.  Launch Weston in the shell:

    ```
         weston

    ```

### 4.8. Licenses[¶][882]

This section describes the mechanism by which the OpenEmbedded build system tracks changes to licensing text. The section also describes how to enable commercially licensed recipes, which by default are disabled.

For information that can help you maintain compliance with various open source licensing during the lifecycle of the product, see the "[Maintaining Open Source License Compliance During Your Project's Lifecycle][4228]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

### 4.8.1. Tracking License Changes[¶][461]

The license of an upstream project might change in the future. In order to prevent these changes going unnoticed, the `[LIC_FILES_CHKSUM][3474]` variable tracks changes to the license text. The checksums are validated at the end of the configure step, and if the checksums do not match, the build will fail.

#### 4.8.1.1. Specifying the `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` Variable[¶][34]

The `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` variable contains checksums of the license text in the source code for the recipe. Following is an example of how to specify`LIC_FILES_CHKSUM`:

```
     LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://COPYING;md5=xxxx \
                         file://licfile1.txt;beginline=5;endline=29;md5=yyyy \
                         file://licfile2.txt;endline=50;md5=zzzz \
                         ..."

```

### Notes

*   When using "beginline" and "endline", realize that line numbering begins with one and not zero. Also, the included lines are inclusive (i.e. lines five through and including 29 in the previous example for `licfile1.txt`).

*   When a license check fails, the selected license text is included as part of the QA message. Using this output, you can determine the exact start and finish for the needed license text.

The build system uses the `[S][1875]` variable as the default directory when searching files listed in `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM`. The previous example employs the default directory.

Consider this next example:

```
     LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://src/ls.c;beginline=5;endline=16;\
                                         md5=bb14ed3c4cda583abc85401304b5cd4e"
     LIC_FILES_CHKSUM = "file://${WORKDIR}/license.html;md5=5c94767cedb5d6987c902ac850ded2c6"

```

The first line locates a file in `${S}/src/ls.c` and isolates lines five through 16 as license text. The second line refers to a file in `[WORKDIR][1876]`.

Note that `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` variable is mandatory for all recipes, unless the `LICENSE` variable is set to "CLOSED".

#### 4.8.1.2. Explanation of Syntax[¶][35]

As mentioned in the previous section, the `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` variable lists all the important files that contain the license text for the source code. It is possible to specify a checksum for an entire file, or a specific section of a file (specified by beginning and ending line numbers with the "beginline" and "endline" parameters, respectively). The latter is useful for source files with a license notice header, README documents, and so forth. If you do not use the "beginline" parameter, then it is assumed that the text begins on the first line of the file. Similarly, if you do not use the "endline" parameter, it is assumed that the license text ends with the last line of the file.

The "md5" parameter stores the md5 checksum of the license text. If the license text changes in any way as compared to this parameter then a mismatch occurs. This mismatch triggers a build failure and notifies the developer. Notification allows the developer to review and address the license text changes. Also note that if a mismatch occurs during the build, the correct md5 checksum is placed in the build log and can be easily copied to the recipe.

There is no limit to how many files you can specify using the `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` variable. Generally, however, every project requires a few specifications for license tracking. Many projects have a "COPYING" file that stores the license information for all the source code files. This practice allows you to just track the "COPYING" file as long as it is kept up to date.

### Tip

If you specify an empty or invalid "md5" parameter, BitBake returns an md5 mis-match error and displays the correct "md5" parameter value during the build. The correct parameter is also captured in the build log.

### Tip

If the whole file contains only license text, you do not need to use the "beginline" and "endline" parameters.

### 4.8.2. Enabling Commercially Licensed Recipes[¶][462]

By default, the OpenEmbedded build system disables components that have commercial or other special licensing requirements. Such requirements are defined on a recipe-by-recipe basis through the [`LICENSE_FLAGS`][3859] variable definition in the affected recipe. For instance, the `poky/meta/recipes-multimedia/gstreamer/gst-plugins-ugly` recipe contains the following statement:

```
     LICENSE_FLAGS = "commercial"

```

Here is a slightly more complicated example that contains both an explicit recipe name and version (after variable expansion):

```
     LICENSE_FLAGS = "license_${PN}_${PV}"

```

In order for a component restricted by a `LICENSE_FLAGS` definition to be enabled and included in an image, it needs to have a matching entry in the global [`LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST`][3860] variable, which is a variable typically defined in your `local.conf` file. For example, to enable the `poky/meta/recipes-multimedia/gstreamer/gst-plugins-ugly` package, you could add either the string "commercial_gst-plugins-ugly" or the more general string "commercial" to `LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST`. See the "[License Flag Matching][3861]" section for a full explanation of how `LICENSE_FLAGS`matching works. Here is the example:

```
     LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST = "commercial_gst-plugins-ugly"

```

Likewise, to additionally enable the package built from the recipe containing `LICENSE_FLAGS = "license_${PN}_${PV}"`, and assuming that the actual recipe name was `emgd_1.10.bb`, the following string would enable that package as well as the original `gst-plugins-ugly` package:

```
     LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST = "commercial_gst-plugins-ugly license_emgd_1.10"

```

As a convenience, you do not need to specify the complete license string in the whitelist for every package. You can use an abbreviated form, which consists of just the first portion or portions of the license string before the initial underscore character or characters. A partial string will match any license that contains the given string as the first portion of its license. For example, the following whitelist string will also match both of the packages previously mentioned as well as any other packages that have licenses starting with "commercial" or "license".

```
     LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST = "commercial license"

```

#### 4.8.2.1. License Flag Matching[¶][36]

License flag matching allows you to control what recipes the OpenEmbedded build system includes in the build. Fundamentally, the build system attempts to match [`LICENSE_FLAGS`][3475] strings found in recipes against [`LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST`][3476] strings found in the whitelist. A match causes the build system to include a recipe in the build, while failure to find a match causes the build system to exclude a recipe.

In general, license flag matching is simple. However, understanding some concepts will help you correctly and effectively use matching.

Before a flag defined by a particular recipe is tested against the contents of the whitelist, the expanded string `_${PN}` is appended to the flag. This expansion makes each `LICENSE_FLAGS` value recipe-specific. After expansion, the string is then matched against the whitelist. Thus, specifying`LICENSE_FLAGS = "commercial"` in recipe "foo", for example, results in the string `"commercial_foo"`. And, to create a match, that string must appear in the whitelist.

Judicious use of the `LICENSE_FLAGS` strings and the contents of the `LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST` variable allows you a lot of flexibility for including or excluding recipes based on licensing. For example, you can broaden the matching capabilities by using license flags string subsets in the whitelist.

### Note

When using a string subset, be sure to use the part of the expanded string that precedes the appended underscore character (e.g. `usethispart_1.3`, `usethispart_1.4`, and so forth).

For example, simply specifying the string "commercial" in the whitelist matches any expanded `LICENSE_FLAGS` definition that starts with the string "commercial" such as "commercial_foo" and "commercial_bar", which are the strings the build system automatically generates for hypothetical recipes named "foo" and "bar" assuming those recipes simply specify the following:

```
     LICENSE_FLAGS = "commercial"

```

Thus, you can choose to exhaustively enumerate each license flag in the whitelist and allow only specific recipes into the image, or you can use a string subset that causes a broader range of matches to allow a range of recipes into the image.

This scheme works even if the `LICENSE_FLAGS` string already has `_${PN}` appended. For example, the build system turns the license flag "commercial_1.2_foo" into "commercial_1.2_foo_foo" and would match both the general "commercial" and the specific "commercial_1.2_foo" strings found in the whitelist, as expected.

Here are some other scenarios:

*   You can specify a versioned string in the recipe such as "commercial_foo_1.2" in a "foo" recipe. The build system expands this string to "commercial_foo_1.2_foo". Combine this license flag with a whitelist that has the string "commercial" and you match the flag along with any other flag that starts with the string "commercial".

*   Under the same circumstances, you can use "commercial_foo" in the whitelist and the build system not only matches "commercial_foo_1.2" but also matches any license flag with the string "commercial_foo", regardless of the version.

*   You can be very specific and use both the package and version parts in the whitelist (e.g. "commercial_foo_1.2") to specifically match a versioned recipe.

#### 4.8.2.2. Other Variables Related to Commercial Licenses[¶][37]

Other helpful variables related to commercial license handling exist and are defined in the `poky/meta/conf/distro/include/default-distrovars.inc` file:

```
     COMMERCIAL_AUDIO_PLUGINS ?= ""
     COMMERCIAL_VIDEO_PLUGINS ?= ""

```

If you want to enable these components, you can do so by making sure you have statements similar to the following in your `local.conf` configuration file:

```
     COMMERCIAL_AUDIO_PLUGINS = "gst-plugins-ugly-mad \
        gst-plugins-ugly-mpegaudioparse"
     COMMERCIAL_VIDEO_PLUGINS = "gst-plugins-ugly-mpeg2dec \
        gst-plugins-ugly-mpegstream gst-plugins-bad-mpegvideoparse"
     LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST = "commercial_gst-plugins-ugly commercial_gst-plugins-bad commercial_qmmp"

```

Of course, you could also create a matching whitelist for those components using the more general "commercial" in the whitelist, but that would also enable all the other packages with [`LICENSE_FLAGS`][3477] containing "commercial", which you may or may not want:

```
     LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST = "commercial"

```

Specifying audio and video plug-ins as part of the `COMMERCIAL_AUDIO_PLUGINS` and `COMMERCIAL_VIDEO_PLUGINS` statements (along with the enabling`LICENSE_FLAGS_WHITELIST`) includes the plug-ins or components into built images, thus adding support for media formats or components.

### Chapter 5. Yocto Project Releases and the Stable Release Process[¶][1877]


The Yocto Project release process is predictable and consists of both major and minor (point) releases. This brief chapter provides information on how releases are named, their life cycle, and their stability.

### 5.1. Major and Minor Release Cadence[¶][883]

The Yocto Project delivers major releases (e.g. 2.3) using a six month cadence roughly timed each April and October of the year. Following are examples of some major YP releases with their codenames also shown. See the "[Major Release Codenames][4229]" section for information on codenames used with major releases.

```
    2.2 (Morty)
    2.1 (Krogoth)
    2.0 (Jethro)

```

While the cadence is never perfect, this timescale facilitates regular releases that have strong QA cycles while not overwhelming users with too many new releases. The cadence is predictable and avoids many major holidays in various geographies.

The Yocto project delivers minor (point) releases on an unscheduled basis and are usually driven by the accumulation of enough significant fixes or enhancements to the associated major release. Following are some example past point releases:

```
    2.1.1
    2.1.2
    2.2.1

```

The point release indicates a point in the major release branch where a full QA cycle and release process validates the content of the new branch.

### Note

Realize that there can be patches merged onto the stable release branches as and when they become available.

### 5.2. Major Release Codenames[¶][884]

Each major release receives a codename that identifies the release in the [Yocto Project Source Repositories][4230]. The concept is that branches of [Metadata][4231]with the same codename are likely to be compatible and thus work together.

### Note

Codenames are associated with major releases because a Yocto Project release number (e.g. 2.3) could conflict with a given layer or company versioning scheme. Codenames are unique, interesting, and easily identifiable.

Releases are given a nominal release version as well but the codename is used in repositories for this reason. You can find information on Yocto Project releases and codenames at [https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Releases][4232].

### 5.3. Stable Release Process[¶][885]

Once released, the release enters the stable release process at which time a person is assigned as the maintainer for that stable release. This maintainer monitors activity for the release by investigating and handling nominated patches and backport activity. Only fixes and enhancements that have first been applied on the "master" branch (i.e. the current, in-development branch) are considered for backporting to a stable release.

### Note

The current Yocto Project policy regarding backporting is to consider bug fixes and security fixes only. Policy dictates that features are not backported to a stable release. This policy means generic recipe version upgrades are unlikely to be accepted for backporting. The exception to this policy occurs when a strong reason exists such as the fix happens to also be the preferred upstream approach.

Stable release branches have strong maintenance for about a year after their initial release. Should significant issues be found for any release regardless of its age, fixes could be backported to older releases. For issues that are not backported given an older release, Community LTS trees and branches exist where community members share patches for older releases. However, these types of patches do not go through the same release process as do point releases. You can find more information about stable branch maintenance at[https://wiki.yoctoproject.org/wiki/Stable_branch_maintenance][4233].

### 5.4. Testing and Quality Assurance[¶][886]

Part of the Yocto Project development and release process is quality assurance through the execution of test strategies. Test strategies provide the Yocto Project team a way to ensure a release is validated. Additionally, because the test strategies are visible to you as a developer, you can validate your projects. This section overviews the available test infrastructure used in the Yocto Project. For information on how to run available tests on your projects, see the "[Performing Automated Runtime Testing][4234]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

The QA/testing infrastructure is woven into the project to the point where core developers take some of it for granted. The infrastructure consists of the following pieces:

*   `bitbake-selftest`: A standalone command that runs unit tests on key pieces of BitBake and its fetchers.

*   [`sanity.bbclass`][1878]: This automatically included class checks the build environment for missing tools (e.g. `gcc`) or common misconfigurations such as[`MACHINE`][1879] set incorrectly.

*   [`insane.bbclass`][1880]: This class checks the generated output from builds for sanity. For example, if building for an ARM target, did the build produce ARM binaries. If, for example, the build produced PPC binaries then there is a problem.

*   [`testimage.bbclass`][1881]: This class performs runtime testing of images after they are built. The tests are usually used with [QEMU][1882] to boot the images and check the combined runtime result boot operation and functions. However, the test can also use the IP address of a machine to test.

*   [`ptest`][1883]: Runs tests against packages produced during the build for a given piece of software. The test allows the packages to be be run within a target image.

*   `oe-selftest`: Tests combination BitBake invocations. These tests operate outside the OpenEmbedded build system itself. The `oe-selftest` can run all tests by default or can run selected tests or test suites.

    ### Note

    Running `oe-selftest` requires host packages beyond the "Essential" grouping. See the "[Required Packages for the Host Development System][1884]" section for more information.

Originally, much of this testing was done manually. However, significant effort has been made to automate the tests so that more people can use them and the Yocto Project development team can run them faster and more efficiently.

The Yocto Project's main Autobuilder (`autobuilder.yoctoproject.org`) publicly tests each Yocto Project release's code in the OE-Core, Poky, and BitBake repositories. The testing occurs for both the current state of the "master" branch and also for submitted patches. Testing for submitted patches usually occurs in the "ross/mut" branch in the `poky-contrib` repository (i.e. the master-under-test branch) or in the "master-next" branch in the `poky`repository.

### Note

You can find all these branches in the Yocto Project [Source Repositories][4235].

Testing within these public branches ensures in a publicly visible way that all of the main supposed architectures and recipes in OE-Core successfully build and behave properly.

Various features such as `multilib`, sub architectures (e.g. `x32`, `poky-tiny`, `musl`, `no-x11` and and so forth), `bitbake-selftest`, and `oe-selftest` are tested as part of the QA process of a release. Complete testing and validation for a release takes the Autobuilder workers several hours.

### Note

The Autobuilder workers are non-homogeneous, which means regular testing across a variety of Linux distributions occurs. The Autobuilder is limited to only testing QEMU-based setups and not real hardware.

Finally, in addition to the Autobuilder's tests, the Yocto Project QA team also performs testing on a variety of platforms, which includes actual hardware, to ensure expected results.

### Chapter 6. Migrating to a Newer Yocto Project Release[¶][1885]



This chapter provides information you can use to migrate work to a newer Yocto Project release. You can find the same information in the release notes for a given release.

### 6.1. General Migration Considerations[¶][1004]

Some considerations are not tied to a specific Yocto Project release. This section presents information you should consider when migrating to any new Yocto Project release.

*   _Dealing with Customized Recipes_ : Issues could arise if you take older recipes that contain customizations and simply copy them forward expecting them to work after you migrate to new Yocto Project metadata. For example, suppose you have a recipe in your layer that is a customized version of a core recipe copied from the earlier release, rather than through the use of an append file. When you migrate to a newer version of Yocto Project, the metadata (e.g. perhaps an include file used by the recipe) could have changed in a way that would break the build. Say, for example, a function is removed from an include file and the customized recipe tries to call that function.

    You could "forward-port" all your customizations in your recipe so that everything works for the new release. However, this is not the optimal solution as you would have to repeat this process with each new release if changes occur that give rise to problems.

    The better solution (where practical) is to use append files (`*.bbappend`) to capture any customizations you want to make to a recipe. Doing so, isolates your changes from the main recipe making them much more manageable. However, sometimes it is not practical to use an append file. A good example of this is when introducing a newer or older version of a recipe in another layer.

*   _Updating Append Files_ : Since append files generally only contain your customizations, they often do not need to be adjusted for new releases. However, if the `.bbappend` file is specific to a particular version of the recipe (i.e. its name does not use the % wildcard) and the version of the recipe to which it is appending has changed, then you will at a minimum need to rename the append file to match the name of the recipe file. A mismatch between an append file and its corresponding recipe file (`.bb`) will trigger an error during parsing.

    Depending on the type of customization the append file applies, other incompatibilities might occur when you upgrade. For example, if your append file applies a patch and the recipe to which it is appending is updated to a newer version, the patch might no longer apply. If this is the case and assuming the patch is still needed, you must modify the patch file so that it does apply.

### 6.2. Moving to the Yocto Project 1.3 Release[¶][1005]

This section provides migration information for moving to the Yocto Project 1.3 Release from the prior release.

### 6.2.1. Local Configuration[¶][463]

Differences include changes for [`SSTATE_MIRRORS`][3862] and `bblayers.conf`.

#### 6.2.1.1. SSTATE_MIRRORS[¶][38]

The shared state cache (sstate-cache), as pointed to by [`SSTATE_DIR`][3493], by default now has two-character subdirectories to prevent issues arising from too many files in the same directory. Also, native sstate-cache packages, which are built to run on the host system, will go into a subdirectory named using the distro ID string. If you copy the newly structured sstate-cache to a mirror location (either local or remote) and then point to it in[`SSTATE_MIRRORS`][3494], you need to append "PATH" to the end of the mirror URL so that the path used by BitBake before the mirror substitution is appended to the path used to access the mirror. Here is an example:

```
     SSTATE_MIRRORS = "file://.* http://someserver.tld/share/sstate/PATH"

```

#### 6.2.1.2. bblayers.conf[¶][39]

The `meta-yocto` layer consists of two parts that correspond to the Poky reference distribution and the reference hardware Board Support Packages (BSPs), respectively: `meta-yocto` and `meta-yocto-bsp`. When running BitBake for the first time after upgrading, your `conf/bblayers.conf` file will be updated to handle this change and you will be asked to re-run or restart for the changes to take effect.

### 6.2.2. Recipes[¶][464]

Differences include changes for the following:

*   Python function whitespace

*   `proto=` in `SRC_URI`

*   `nativesdk`

*   Task recipes

*   `IMAGE_FEATURES`

*   Removed recipes

#### 6.2.2.1. Python Function Whitespace[¶][40]

All Python functions must now use four spaces for indentation. Previously, an inconsistent mix of spaces and tabs existed, which made extending these functions using `_append` or `_prepend` complicated given that Python treats whitespace as syntactically significant. If you are defining or extending any Python functions (e.g. `populate_packages`, `do_unpack`, `do_patch` and so forth) in custom recipes or classes, you need to ensure you are using consistent four-space indentation.

#### 6.2.2.2. proto= in SRC_URI[¶][41]

Any use of `proto=` in [`SRC_URI`][3495] needs to be changed to `protocol=`. In particular, this applies to the following URIs:

*   `svn://`

*   `bzr://`

*   `hg://`

*   `osc://`

Other URIs were already using `protocol=`. This change improves consistency.

#### 6.2.2.3. nativesdk[¶][42]

The suffix `nativesdk` is now implemented as a prefix, which simplifies a lot of the packaging code for `nativesdk` recipes. All custom `nativesdk`recipes, which are relocatable packages that are native to [`SDK_ARCH`][3496], and any references need to be updated to use `nativesdk-*` instead of `*-nativesdk`.

#### 6.2.2.4. Task Recipes[¶][43]

"Task" recipes are now known as "Package groups" and have been renamed from `task-*.bb` to `packagegroup-*.bb`. Existing references to the previous `task-*` names should work in most cases as there is an automatic upgrade path for most packages. However, you should update references in your own recipes and configurations as they could be removed in future releases. You should also rename any custom `task-*` recipes to `packagegroup-*`, and change them to inherit `packagegroup` instead of `task`, as well as taking the opportunity to remove anything now handled by`packagegroup.bbclass`, such as providing `-dev` and `-dbg` packages, setting [`LIC_FILES_CHKSUM`][3497], and so forth. See the "[`packagegroup.bbclass`][3498]" section for further details.

#### 6.2.2.5. IMAGE_FEATURES[¶][44]

Image recipes that previously included "apps-console-core" in [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][3499] should now include "splash" instead to enable the boot-up splash screen. Retaining "apps-console-core" will still include the splash screen but generates a warning. The "apps-x11-core" and "apps-x11-games"`IMAGE_FEATURES` features have been removed.

#### 6.2.2.6. Removed Recipes[¶][45]

The following recipes have been removed. For most of them, it is unlikely that you would have any references to them in your own [Metadata][3500]. However, you should check your metadata against this list to be sure:

*   _`libx11-trim`_ : Replaced by `libx11`, which has a negligible size difference with modern Xorg.

*   _`xserver-xorg-lite`_ : Use `xserver-xorg`, which has a negligible size difference when DRI and GLX modules are not installed.

*   _`xserver-kdrive`_ : Effectively unmaintained for many years.

*   _`mesa-xlib`_ : No longer serves any purpose.

*   _`galago`_ : Replaced by telepathy.

*   _`gail`_ : Functionality was integrated into GTK+ 2.13.

*   _`eggdbus`_ : No longer needed.

*   _`gcc-*-intermediate`_ : The build has been restructured to avoid the need for this step.

*   _`libgsmd`_ : Unmaintained for many years. Functionality now provided by `ofono` instead.

*   _contacts, dates, tasks, eds-tools_ : Largely unmaintained PIM application suite. It has been moved to `meta-gnome` in `meta-openembedded`.

In addition to the previously listed changes, the `meta-demoapps` directory has also been removed because the recipes in it were not being maintained and many had become obsolete or broken. Additionally, these recipes were not parsed in the default configuration. Many of these recipes are already provided in an updated and maintained form within the OpenEmbedded community layers such as `meta-oe` and `meta-gnome`. For the remainder, you can now find them in the `meta-extras` repository, which is in the Yocto Project [Source Repositories][3501].

### 6.2.3. Linux Kernel Naming[¶][465]

The naming scheme for kernel output binaries has been changed to now include [`PE`][3863] as part of the filename:

```
     KERNEL_IMAGE_BASE_NAME ?= "${KERNEL_IMAGETYPE}-${PE}-${PV}-${PR}-${MACHINE}-${DATETIME}"

```

Because the `PE` variable is not set by default, these binary files could result with names that include two dash characters. Here is an example:

```
     bzImage--3.10.9+git0+cd502a8814_7144bcc4b8-r0-qemux86-64-20130830085431.bin

```

### 6.3. Moving to the Yocto Project 1.4 Release[¶][1006]

This section provides migration information for moving to the Yocto Project 1.4 Release from the prior release.

### 6.3.1. BitBake[¶][466]

Differences include the following:

*   _Comment Continuation:_  If a comment ends with a line continuation (\) character, then the next line must also be a comment. Any instance where this is not the case, now triggers a warning. You must either remove the continuation character, or be sure the next line is a comment.

*   _Package Name Overrides:_  The runtime package specific variables [`RDEPENDS`][1007], [`RRECOMMENDS`][1008], [`RSUGGESTS`][1009], [`RPROVIDES`][1010], [`RCONFLICTS`][1011], [`RREPLACES`][1012],[`FILES`][1013], [`ALLOW_EMPTY`][1014], and the pre, post, install, and uninstall script functions `pkg_preinst`, `pkg_postinst`, `pkg_prerm`, and `pkg_postrm` should always have a package name override. For example, use `RDEPENDS_${PN}` for the main package instead of `RDEPENDS`. BitBake uses more strict checks when it parses recipes.

### 6.3.2. Build Behavior[¶][467]

Differences include the following:

*   _Shared State Code:_  The shared state code has been optimized to avoid running unnecessary tasks. For example, the following no longer populates the target sysroot since that is not necessary:

    ```
         $ bitbake -c rootfs some-image

    ```

    Instead, the system just needs to extract the output package contents, re-create the packages, and construct the root filesystem. This change is unlikely to cause any problems unless you have missing declared dependencies.

*   _Scanning Directory Names:_  When scanning for files in [`SRC_URI`][1015], the build system now uses [`FILESOVERRIDES`][1016] instead of [`OVERRIDES`][1017] for the directory names. In general, the values previously in `OVERRIDES` are now in `FILESOVERRIDES` as well. However, if you relied upon an additional value you previously added to `OVERRIDES`, you might now need to add it to `FILESOVERRIDES` unless you are already adding it through the[`MACHINEOVERRIDES`][1018] or [`DISTROOVERRIDES`][1019] variables, as appropriate. For more related changes, see the "[Variables][1020]" section.

### 6.3.3. Proxies and Fetching Source[¶][468]

A new `oe-git-proxy` script has been added to replace previous methods of handling proxies and fetching source from Git. See the `meta-yocto/conf/site.conf.sample` file for information on how to use this script.

### 6.3.4. Custom Interfaces File (netbase change)[¶][469]

If you have created your own custom `etc/network/interfaces` file by creating an append file for the `netbase` recipe, you now need to create an append file for the `init-ifupdown` recipe instead, which you can find in the [Source Directory][3864] at `meta/recipes-core/init-ifupdown`. For information on how to use append files, see the "[Using .bbappend Files][3865]" in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

### 6.3.5. Remote Debugging[¶][470]

Support for remote debugging with the Eclipse IDE is now separated into an image feature (`eclipse-debug`) that corresponds to the `packagegroup-core-eclipse-debug` package group. Previously, the debugging feature was included through the `tools-debug` image feature, which corresponds to the `packagegroup-core-tools-debug` package group.

### 6.3.6. Variables[¶][471]

The following variables have changed:

*   _`SANITY_TESTED_DISTROS`:_  This variable now uses a distribution ID, which is composed of the host distributor ID followed by the release. Previously,[`SANITY_TESTED_DISTROS`][1021] was composed of the description field. For example, "Ubuntu 12.10" becomes "Ubuntu-12.10". You do not need to worry about this change if you are not specifically setting this variable, or if you are specifically setting it to "".

*   _`SRC_URI`:_  The `${`[`PN`][1022]`}`, `${`[`PF`][1023]`}`, `${`[`P`][1024]`}`, and `FILE_DIRNAME` directories have been dropped from the default value of the [`FILESPATH`][1025] variable, which is used as the search path for finding files referred to in [`SRC_URI`][1026]. If you have a recipe that relied upon these directories, which would be unusual, then you will need to add the appropriate paths within the recipe or, alternatively, rearrange the files. The most common locations are still covered by `${BP}`, `${BPN}`, and "files", which all remain in the default value of [`FILESPATH`][1027].

### 6.3.7. Target Package Management with RPM[¶][472]

If runtime package management is enabled and the RPM backend is selected, Smart is now installed for package download, dependency resolution, and upgrades instead of Zypper. For more information on how to use Smart, run the following command on the target:

```
     smart --help

```

### 6.3.8. Recipes Moved[¶][473]

The following recipes were moved from their previous locations because they are no longer used by anything in the OpenEmbedded-Core:

*   _`clutter-box2d`:_  Now resides in the `meta-oe` layer.

*   _`evolution-data-server`:_  Now resides in the `meta-gnome` layer.

*   _`gthumb`:_  Now resides in the `meta-gnome` layer.

*   _`gtkhtml2`:_  Now resides in the `meta-oe` layer.

*   _`gupnp`:_  Now resides in the `meta-multimedia` layer.

*   _`gypsy`:_  Now resides in the `meta-oe` layer.

*   _`libcanberra`:_  Now resides in the `meta-gnome` layer.

*   _`libgdata`:_  Now resides in the `meta-gnome` layer.

*   _`libmusicbrainz`:_  Now resides in the `meta-multimedia` layer.

*   _`metacity`:_  Now resides in the `meta-gnome` layer.

*   _`polkit`:_  Now resides in the `meta-oe` layer.

*   _`zeroconf`:_  Now resides in the `meta-networking` layer.

### 6.3.9. Removals and Renames[¶][474]

The following list shows what has been removed or renamed:

*   _`evieext`:_  Removed because it has been removed from `xserver` since 2008.

*   _Gtk+ DirectFB:_  Removed support because upstream Gtk+ no longer supports it as of version 2.18.

*   _`libxfontcache / xfontcacheproto`:_  Removed because they were removed from the Xorg server in 2008.

*   _`libxp / libxprintapputil / libxprintutil / printproto`:_  Removed because the XPrint server was removed from Xorg in 2008.

*   _`libxtrap / xtrapproto`:_  Removed because their functionality was broken upstream.

*   _linux-yocto 3.0 kernel:_  Removed with linux-yocto 3.8 kernel being added. The linux-yocto 3.2 and linux-yocto 3.4 kernels remain as part of the release.

*   _`lsbsetup`:_  Removed with functionality now provided by `lsbtest`.

*   _`matchbox-stroke`:_  Removed because it was never more than a proof-of-concept.

*   _`matchbox-wm-2 / matchbox-theme-sato-2`:_  Removed because they are not maintained. However, `matchbox-wm` and `matchbox-theme-sato` are still provided.

*   _`mesa-dri`:_  Renamed to `mesa`.

*   _`mesa-xlib`:_  Removed because it was no longer useful.

*   _`mutter`:_  Removed because nothing ever uses it and the recipe is very old.

*   _`orinoco-conf`:_  Removed because it has become obsolete.

*   _`update-modules`:_  Removed because it is no longer used. The kernel module `postinstall` and `postrm` scripts can now do the same task without the use of this script.

*   _`web`:_  Removed because it is not maintained. Superseded by `web-webkit`.

*   _`xf86bigfontproto`:_  Removed because upstream it has been disabled by default since 2007\. Nothing uses `xf86bigfontproto`.

*   _`xf86rushproto`:_  Removed because its dependency in `xserver` was spurious and it was removed in 2005.

*   _`zypper / libzypp / sat-solver`:_  Removed and been functionally replaced with Smart (`python-smartpm`) when RPM packaging is used and package management is enabled on the target.

### 6.4. Moving to the Yocto Project 1.5 Release[¶][1028]

This section provides migration information for moving to the Yocto Project 1.5 Release from the prior release.

### 6.4.1. Host Dependency Changes[¶][475]

The OpenEmbedded build system now has some additional requirements on the host system:

*   Python 2.7.3+

*   Tar 1.24+

*   Git 1.7.8+

*   Patched version of Make if you are using 3.82\. Most distributions that provide Make 3.82 use the patched version.

If the Linux distribution you are using on your build host does not provide packages for these, you can install and use the Buildtools tarball, which provides an SDK-like environment containing them.

For more information on this requirement, see the "[Required Git, tar, and Python Versions][3866]" section.

### 6.4.2. `atom-pc` Board Support Package (BSP)[¶][476]

The `atom-pc` hardware reference BSP has been replaced by a `genericx86` BSP. This BSP is not necessarily guaranteed to work on all x86 hardware, but it will run on a wider range of systems than the `atom-pc` did.

### Note

Additionally, a `genericx86-64` BSP has been added for 64-bit Atom systems.

### 6.4.3. BitBake[¶][477]

The following changes have been made that relate to BitBake:

*   BitBake now supports a `_remove` operator. The addition of this operator means you will have to rename any items in recipe space (functions, variables) whose names currently contain `_remove_` or end with `_remove` to avoid unexpected behavior.

*   BitBake's global method pool has been removed. This method is not particularly useful and led to clashes between recipes containing functions that had the same name.

*   The "none" server backend has been removed. The "process" server backend has been serving well as the default for a long time now.

*   The `bitbake-runtask` script has been removed.

*   `${`[`P`][1029]`}` and `${`[`PF`][1030]`}` are no longer added to [`PROVIDES`][1031] by default in `bitbake.conf`. These version-specific `PROVIDES` items were seldom used. Attempting to use them could result in two versions being built simultaneously rather than just one version due to the way BitBake resolves dependencies.

### 6.4.4. QA Warnings[¶][478]

The following changes have been made to the package QA checks:

*   If you have customized [`ERROR_QA`][1032] or [`WARN_QA`][1033] values in your configuration, check that they contain all of the issues that you wish to be reported. Previous Yocto Project versions contained a bug that meant that any item not mentioned in `ERROR_QA` or `WARN_QA` would be treated as a warning. Consequently, several important items were not already in the default value of `WARN_QA`. All of the possible QA checks are now documented in the "[`insane.bbclass`][1034]" section.

*   An additional QA check has been added to check if `/usr/share/info/dir` is being installed. Your recipe should delete this file within [`do_install`][1035] if "make install" is installing it.

*   If you are using the buildhistory class, the check for the package version going backwards is now controlled using a standard QA check. Thus, if you have customized your `ERROR_QA` or `WARN_QA` values and still wish to have this check performed, you should add "version-going-backwards" to your value for one or the other variables depending on how you wish it to be handled. See the documented QA checks in the "[`insane.bbclass`][1036]" section.

### 6.4.5. Directory Layout Changes[¶][479]

The following directory changes exist:

*   Output SDK installer files are now named to include the image name and tuning architecture through the [`SDK_NAME`][1037] variable.

*   Images and related files are now installed into a directory that is specific to the machine, instead of a parent directory containing output files for multiple machines. The [`DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE`][1038] variable continues to point to the directory containing images for the current [`MACHINE`][1039] and should be used anywhere there is a need to refer to this directory. The `runqemu` script now uses this variable to find images and kernel binaries and will use BitBake to determine the directory. Alternatively, you can set the `DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE` variable in the external environment.

*   When buildhistory is enabled, its output is now written under the [Build Directory][1040] rather than [`TMPDIR`][1041]. Doing so makes it easier to delete `TMPDIR` and preserve the build history. Additionally, data for produced SDKs is now split by [`IMAGE_NAME`][1042].

*   The `pkgdata` directory produced as part of the packaging process has been collapsed into a single machine-specific directory. This directory is located under `sysroots` and uses a machine-specific name (i.e. `tmp/sysroots/ _`machine`_ /pkgdata`).

### 6.4.6. Shortened Git `SRCREV` Values[¶][480]

BitBake will now shorten revisions from Git repositories from the normal 40 characters down to 10 characters within [`SRCPV`][3867] for improved usability in path and file names. This change should be safe within contexts where these revisions are used because the chances of spatially close collisions is very low. Distant collisions are not a major issue in the way the values are used.

### 6.4.7. `IMAGE_FEATURES`[¶][481]

The following changes have been made that relate to [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][3868]:

*   The value of [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][1043] is now validated to ensure invalid feature items are not added. Some users mistakenly add package names to this variable instead of using [`IMAGE_INSTALL`][1044] in order to have the package added to the image, which does not work. This change is intended to catch those kinds of situations. Valid `IMAGE_FEATURES` are drawn from [`PACKAGE_GROUP`][1045] definitions, [`COMPLEMENTARY_GLOB`][1046] and a new "validitems" varflag on`IMAGE_FEATURES`. The "validitems" varflag change allows additional features to be added if they are not provided using the previous two mechanisms.

*   The previously deprecated "apps-console-core" `IMAGE_FEATURES` item is no longer supported. Add "splash" to `IMAGE_FEATURES` if you wish to have the splash screen enabled, since this is all that apps-console-core was doing.

### 6.4.8. `/run`[¶][482]

The `/run` directory from the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard 3.0 has been introduced. You can find some of the implications for this change [here][3869]. The change also means that recipes that install files to `/var/run` must be changed. You can find a guide on how to make these changes [here][3870].

### 6.4.9. Removal of Package Manager Database Within Image Recipes[¶][483]

The image `core-image-minimal` no longer adds `remove_packaging_data_files` to [`ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND`][3871]. This addition is now handled automatically when "package-management" is not in [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][3872]. If you have custom image recipes that make this addition, you should remove the lines, as they are not needed and might interfere with correct operation of postinstall scripts.

### 6.4.10. Images Now Rebuild Only on Changes Instead of Every Time[¶][484]

The [`do_rootfs`][3873] and other related image construction tasks are no longer marked as "nostamp". Consequently, they will only be re-executed when their inputs have changed. Previous versions of the OpenEmbedded build system always rebuilt the image when requested rather when necessary.

### 6.4.11. Task Recipes[¶][485]

The previously deprecated `task.bbclass` has now been dropped. For recipes that previously inherited from this class, you should rename them from `task-*` to `packagegroup-*` and inherit packagegroup instead.

For more information, see the "[`packagegroup.bbclass`][3874]" section.

### 6.4.12. BusyBox[¶][486]

By default, we now split BusyBox into two binaries: one that is suid root for those components that need it, and another for the rest of the components. Splitting BusyBox allows for optimization that eliminates the `tinylogin` recipe as recommended by upstream. You can disable this split by setting[`BUSYBOX_SPLIT_SUID`][3875] to "0".

### 6.4.13. Automated Image Testing[¶][487]

A new automated image testing framework has been added through the [`testimage.bbclass`][3876] class. This framework replaces the older `imagetest-qemu`framework.

You can learn more about performing automated image tests in the "[Performing Automated Runtime Testing][3877]" section.

### 6.4.14. Build History[¶][488]

Following are changes to Build History:

*   Installed package sizes: `installed-package-sizes.txt` for an image now records the size of the files installed by each package instead of the size of each compressed package archive file.

*   The dependency graphs (`depends*.dot`) now use the actual package names instead of replacing dashes, dots and plus signs with underscores.

*   The `buildhistory-diff` and `buildhistory-collect-srcrevs` utilities have improved command-line handling. Use the `--help` option for each utility for more information on the new syntax.

For more information on Build History, see the "[Maintaining Build Output Quality][3878]" section.

### 6.4.15. `udev`[¶][489]

Following are changes to `udev`:

*   `udev` no longer brings in `udev-extraconf` automatically through [`RRECOMMENDS`][1047], since this was originally intended to be optional. If you need the extra rules, then add `udev-extraconf` to your image.

*   `udev` no longer brings in `pciutils-ids` or `usbutils-ids` through `RRECOMMENDS`. These are not needed by `udev` itself and removing them saves around 350KB.

### 6.4.16. Removed and Renamed Recipes[¶][490]

*   The `linux-yocto` 3.2 kernel has been removed.

*   `libtool-nativesdk` has been renamed to `nativesdk-libtool`.

*   `tinylogin` has been removed. It has been replaced by a suid portion of Busybox. See the "[BusyBox][1048]" section for more information.

*   `external-python-tarball` has been renamed to `buildtools-tarball`.

*   `web-webkit` has been removed. It has been functionally replaced by `midori`.

*   `imake` has been removed. It is no longer needed by any other recipe.

*   `transfig-native` has been removed. It is no longer needed by any other recipe.

*   `anjuta-remote-run` has been removed. Anjuta IDE integration has not been officially supported for several releases.

### 6.4.17. Other Changes[¶][491]

Following is a list of short entries describing other changes:

*   `run-postinsts`: Make this generic.

*   `base-files`: Remove the unnecessary `media/` _`xxx`_  directories.

*   `alsa-state`: Provide an empty `asound.conf` by default.

*   `classes/image`: Ensure [`BAD_RECOMMENDATIONS`][1049] supports pre-renamed package names.

*   `classes/rootfs_rpm`: Implement [`BAD_RECOMMENDATIONS`][1050] for RPM.

*   `systemd`: Remove `systemd_unitdir` if `systemd` is not in [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][1051].

*   `systemd`: Remove `init.d` dir if `systemd` unit file is present and `sysvinit` is not a distro feature.

*   `libpam`: Deny all services for the `OTHER` entries.

*   `image.bbclass`: Move `runtime_mapping_rename` to avoid conflict with `multilib`. See [`YOCTO #4993`][1052] in Bugzilla for more information.

*   `linux-dtb`: Use kernel build system to generate the `dtb` files.

*   `kern-tools`: Switch from guilt to new `kgit-s2q` tool.

### 6.5. Moving to the Yocto Project 1.6 Release[¶][1053]

This section provides migration information for moving to the Yocto Project 1.6 Release from the prior release.

### 6.5.1. `archiver` Class[¶][492]

The [`archiver`][3879] class has been rewritten and its configuration has been simplified. For more details on the source archiver, see the "[Maintaining Open Source License Compliance During Your Product's Lifecycle][3880]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

### 6.5.2. Packaging Changes[¶][493]

The following packaging changes have been made:

*   The `binutils` recipe no longer produces a `binutils-symlinks` package. `update-alternatives` is now used to handle the preferred `binutils`variant on the target instead.

*   The tc (traffic control) utilities have been split out of the main `iproute2` package and put into the `iproute2-tc` package.

*   The `gtk-engines` schemas have been moved to a dedicated `gtk-engines-schemas` package.

*   The `armv7a` with thumb package architecture suffix has changed. The suffix for these packages with the thumb optimization enabled is "t2" as it should be. Use of this suffix was not the case in the 1.5 release. Architecture names will change within package feeds as a result.

### 6.5.3. BitBake[¶][494]

The following changes have been made to [BitBake][3881].

#### 6.5.3.1. Matching Branch Requirement for Git Fetching[¶][46]

When fetching source from a Git repository using [`SRC_URI`][3502], BitBake will now validate the [`SRCREV`][3503] value against the branch. You can specify the branch using the following form:

```
     SRC_URI = "git://server.name/repository;branch=branchname"

```

If you do not specify a branch, BitBake looks in the default "master" branch.

Alternatively, if you need to bypass this check (e.g. if you are fetching a revision corresponding to a tag that is not on any branch), you can add ";nobranch=1" to the end of the URL within `SRC_URI`.

#### 6.5.3.2. Python Definition substitutions[¶][47]

BitBake had some previously deprecated Python definitions within its `bb` module removed. You should use their sub-module counterparts instead:

*   `bb.MalformedUrl`: Use `bb.fetch.MalformedUrl`.

*   `bb.encodeurl`: Use `bb.fetch.encodeurl`.

*   `bb.decodeurl`: Use `bb.fetch.decodeurl`

*   `bb.mkdirhier`: Use `bb.utils.mkdirhier`.

*   `bb.movefile`: Use `bb.utils.movefile`.

*   `bb.copyfile`: Use `bb.utils.copyfile`.

*   `bb.which`: Use `bb.utils.which`.

*   `bb.vercmp_string`: Use `bb.utils.vercmp_string`.

*   `bb.vercmp`: Use `bb.utils.vercmp`.

#### 6.5.3.3. SVK Fetcher[¶][48]

The SVK fetcher has been removed from BitBake.

#### 6.5.3.4. Console Output Error Redirection[¶][49]

The BitBake console UI will now output errors to `stderr` instead of `stdout`. Consequently, if you are piping or redirecting the output of `bitbake` to somewhere else, and you wish to retain the errors, you will need to add `2>&1` (or something similar) to the end of your `bitbake` command line.

#### 6.5.3.5. `task-` _`taskname`_  Overrides[¶][50]

`task-` _`taskname`_  overrides have been adjusted so that tasks whose names contain underscores have the underscores replaced by hyphens for the override so that they now function properly. For example, the task override for [`do_populate_sdk`][3504] is `task-populate-sdk`.

### 6.5.4. Changes to Variables[¶][495]

The following variables have changed. For information on the OpenEmbedded build system variables, see the "[Variables Glossary][3882]" Chapter.

#### 6.5.4.1. `TMPDIR`[¶][51]

[`TMPDIR`][3505] can no longer be on an NFS mount. NFS does not offer full POSIX locking and inode consistency and can cause unexpected issues if used to store `TMPDIR`.

The check for this occurs on startup. If `TMPDIR` is detected on an NFS mount, an error occurs.

#### 6.5.4.2. `PRINC`[¶][52]

The `PRINC` variable has been deprecated and triggers a warning if detected during a build. For [`PR`][3506] increments on changes, use the PR service instead. You can find out more about this service in the "[Working With a PR Service][3507]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

#### 6.5.4.3. `IMAGE_TYPES`[¶][53]

The "sum.jffs2" option for [`IMAGE_TYPES`][3508] has been replaced by the "jffs2.sum" option, which fits the processing order.

#### 6.5.4.4. `COPY_LIC_MANIFEST`[¶][54]

The [`COPY_LIC_MANIFEST`][3509] variable must now be set to "1" rather than any value in order to enable it.

#### 6.5.4.5. `COPY_LIC_DIRS`[¶][55]

The [`COPY_LIC_DIRS`][3510] variable must now be set to "1" rather than any value in order to enable it.

#### 6.5.4.6. `PACKAGE_GROUP`[¶][56]

The [`PACKAGE_GROUP`][3511] variable has been renamed to [`FEATURE_PACKAGES`][3512] to more accurately reflect its purpose. You can still use `PACKAGE_GROUP` but the OpenEmbedded build system produces a warning message when it encounters the variable.

#### 6.5.4.7. Preprocess and Post Process Command Variable Behavior[¶][57]

The following variables now expect a semicolon separated list of functions to call and not arbitrary shell commands:

```
     ROOTFS_PREPROCESS_COMMAND
     ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND
     SDK_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND
     POPULATE_SDK_POST_TARGET_COMMAND
     POPULATE_SDK_POST_HOST_COMMAND
     IMAGE_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND
     IMAGE_PREPROCESS_COMMAND
     ROOTFS_POSTUNINSTALL_COMMAND
     ROOTFS_POSTINSTALL_COMMAND

```

For migration purposes, you can simply wrap shell commands in a shell function and then call the function. Here is an example:

```
     my_postprocess_function() {
        echo "hello" > ${IMAGE_ROOTFS}/hello.txt
     }
     ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND += "my_postprocess_function; "

```

### 6.5.5. Package Test (ptest)[¶][496]

Package Tests (ptest) are built but not installed by default. For information on using Package Tests, see the "[Setting up and running package test (ptest)][3883]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual. For information on the `ptest` class, see the "[`ptest.bbclass`][3884]" section.

### 6.5.6. Build Changes[¶][497]

Separate build and source directories have been enabled by default for selected recipes where it is known to work (a whitelist) and for all recipes that inherit the [`cmake`][3885] class. In future releases the [`autotools`][3886] class will enable a separate build directory by default as well. Recipes building Autotools-based software that fails to build with a separate build directory should be changed to inherit from the [`autotools-brokensep`][3887] class instead of the `autotools` or `autotools_stage`classes.

### 6.5.7. `qemu-native`[¶][498]

`qemu-native` now builds without SDL-based graphical output support by default. The following additional lines are needed in your `local.conf` to enable it:

```
     PACKAGECONFIG_pn-qemu-native = "sdl"
     ASSUME_PROVIDED += "libsdl-native"

```

### Note

The default `local.conf` contains these statements. Consequently, if you are building a headless system and using a default `local.conf` file, you will need comment these two lines out.

### 6.5.8. `core-image-basic`[¶][499]

`core-image-basic` has been renamed to `core-image-full-cmdline`.

In addition to `core-image-basic` being renamed, `packagegroup-core-basic` has been renamed to `packagegroup-core-full-cmdline` to match.

### 6.5.9. Licensing[¶][500]

The top-level `LICENSE` file has been changed to better describe the license of the various components of OE-Core. However, the licensing itself remains unchanged.

Normally, this change would not cause any side-effects. However, some recipes point to this file within [`LIC_FILES_CHKSUM`][3888] (as `${COREBASE}/LICENSE`) and thus the accompanying checksum must be changed from 3f40d7994397109285ec7b81fdeb3b58 to 4d92cd373abda3937c2bc47fbc49d690\. A better alternative is to have `LIC_FILES_CHKSUM` point to a file describing the license that is distributed with the source that the recipe is building, if possible, rather than pointing to `${COREBASE}/LICENSE`.

### 6.5.10. `CFLAGS` Options[¶][501]

The "-fpermissive" option has been removed from the default [`CFLAGS`][3889] value. You need to take action on individual recipes that fail when building with this option. You need to either patch the recipes to fix the issues reported by the compiler, or you need to add "-fpermissive" to `CFLAGS` in the recipes.

### 6.5.11. Custom Image Output Types[¶][502]

Custom image output types, as selected using [`IMAGE_FSTYPES`][3890], must declare their dependencies on other image types (if any) using a new[`IMAGE_TYPEDEP`][3891] variable.

### 6.5.12. Tasks[¶][503]

The `do_package_write` task has been removed. The task is no longer needed.

### 6.5.13. `update-alternative` Provider[¶][504]

The default `update-alternatives` provider has been changed from `opkg` to `opkg-utils`. This change resolves some troublesome circular dependencies. The runtime package has also been renamed from `update-alternatives-cworth` to `update-alternatives-opkg`.

### 6.5.14. `virtclass` Overrides[¶][505]

The `virtclass` overrides are now deprecated. Use the equivalent class overrides instead (e.g. `virtclass-native` becomes `class-native`.)

### 6.5.15. Removed and Renamed Recipes[¶][506]

The following recipes have been removed:

*   `packagegroup-toolset-native` - This recipe is largely unused.

*   `linux-yocto-3.8` - Support for the Linux yocto 3.8 kernel has been dropped. Support for the 3.10 and 3.14 kernels have been added with the `linux-yocto-3.10` and `linux-yocto-3.14` recipes.

*   `ocf-linux` - This recipe has been functionally replaced using `cryptodev-linux`.

*   `genext2fs` - `genext2fs` is no longer used by the build system and is unmaintained upstream.

*   `js` - This provided an ancient version of Mozilla's javascript engine that is no longer needed.

*   `zaurusd` - The recipe has been moved to the `meta-handheld` layer.

*   `eglibc 2.17` - Replaced by the `eglibc 2.19` recipe.

*   `gcc 4.7.2` - Replaced by the now stable `gcc 4.8.2`.

*   `external-sourcery-toolchain` - this recipe is now maintained in the `meta-sourcery` layer.

*   `linux-libc-headers-yocto 3.4+git` - Now using version 3.10 of the `linux-libc-headers` by default.

*   `meta-toolchain-gmae` - This recipe is obsolete.

*   `packagegroup-core-sdk-gmae` - This recipe is obsolete.

*   `packagegroup-core-standalone-gmae-sdk-target` - This recipe is obsolete.

### 6.5.16. Removed Classes[¶][507]

The following classes have become obsolete and have been removed:

*   `module_strip`

*   `pkg_metainfo`

*   `pkg_distribute`

*   `image-empty`

### 6.5.17. Reference Board Support Packages (BSPs)[¶][508]

The following reference BSPs changes occurred:

*   The BeagleBoard (`beagleboard`) ARM reference hardware has been replaced by the BeagleBone (`beaglebone`) hardware.

*   The RouterStation Pro (`routerstationpro`) MIPS reference hardware has been replaced by the EdgeRouter Lite (`edgerouter`) hardware.

The previous reference BSPs for the `beagleboard` and `routerstationpro` machines are still available in a new `meta-yocto-bsp-old` layer in the[Source Repositories][3892] at [http://git.yoctoproject.org/cgit/cgit.cgi/meta-yocto-bsp-old/][3893].

### 6.6. Moving to the Yocto Project 1.7 Release[¶][1054]

This section provides migration information for moving to the Yocto Project 1.7 Release from the prior release.

### 6.6.1. Changes to Setting QEMU `PACKAGECONFIG` Options in `local.conf`[¶][509]

The QEMU recipe now uses a number of [`PACKAGECONFIG`][3894] options to enable various optional features. The method used to set defaults for these options means that existing `local.conf` files will need to be be modified to append to `PACKAGECONFIG` for `qemu-native` and `nativesdk-qemu` instead of setting it. In other words, to enable graphical output for QEMU, you should now have these lines in `local.conf`:

```
     PACKAGECONFIG_append_pn-qemu-native = " sdl"
     PACKAGECONFIG_append_pn-nativesdk-qemu = " sdl"

```

### 6.6.2. Minimum Git version[¶][510]

The minimum [Git][3895] version required on the build host is now 1.7.8 because the `--list` option is now required by BitBake's Git fetcher. As always, if your host distribution does not provide a version of Git that meets this requirement, you can use the `buildtools-tarball` that does. See the "[Required Git, tar, and Python Versions][3896]" section for more information.

### 6.6.3. Autotools Class Changes[¶][511]

The following [`autotools`][3897] class changes occurred:

*   _A separate build directory is now used by default:_  The `autotools` class has been changed to use a directory for building ([`B`][1055]), which is separate from the source directory ([`S`][1056]). This is commonly referred to as `B != S`, or an out-of-tree build.

    If the software being built is already capable of building in a directory separate from the source, you do not need to do anything. However, if the software is not capable of being built in this manner, you will need to either patch the software so that it can build separately, or you will need to change the recipe to inherit the [`autotools-brokensep`][1057] class instead of the `autotools` or `autotools_stage` classes.

*   _The `--foreign` option is no longer passed to `automake` when running `autoconf`:_  This option tells `automake` that a particular software package does not follow the GNU standards and therefore should not be expected to distribute certain files such as `ChangeLog`, `AUTHORS`, and so forth. Because the majority of upstream software packages already tell `automake` to enable foreign mode themselves, the option is mostly superfluous. However, some recipes will need patches for this change. You can easily make the change by patching `configure.ac` so that it passes "foreign" to `AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE()`. See [this commit][1058] for an example showing how to make the patch.

### 6.6.4. Binary Configuration Scripts Disabled[¶][512]

Some of the core recipes that package binary configuration scripts now disable the scripts due to the scripts previously requiring error-prone path substitution. Software that links against these libraries using these scripts should use the much more robust `pkg-config` instead. The list of recipes changed in this version (and their configuration scripts) is as follows:

```
     directfb (directfb-config)
     freetype (freetype-config)
     gpgme (gpgme-config)
     libassuan (libassuan-config)
     libcroco (croco-6.0-config)
     libgcrypt (libgcrypt-config)
     libgpg-error (gpg-error-config)
     libksba (ksba-config)
     libpcap (pcap-config)
     libpcre (pcre-config)
     libpng (libpng-config, libpng16-config)
     libsdl (sdl-config)
     libusb-compat (libusb-config)
     libxml2 (xml2-config)
     libxslt (xslt-config)
     ncurses (ncurses-config)
     neon (neon-config)
     npth (npth-config)
     pth (pth-config)
     taglib (taglib-config)

```

Additionally, support for `pkg-config` has been added to some recipes in the previous list in the rare cases where the upstream software package does not already provide it.

### 6.6.5. `eglibc 2.19` Replaced with `glibc 2.20`[¶][513]

Because `eglibc` and `glibc` were already fairly close, this replacement should not require any significant changes to other software that links to `eglibc`. However, there were a number of minor changes in `glibc 2.20` upstream that could require patching some software (e.g. the removal of the`_BSD_SOURCE` feature test macro).

`glibc 2.20` requires version 2.6.32 or greater of the Linux kernel. Thus, older kernels will no longer be usable in conjunction with it.

For full details on the changes in `glibc 2.20`, see the upstream release notes [here][3898].

### 6.6.6. Kernel Module Autoloading[¶][514]

The [`module_autoload_*`][3899] variable is now deprecated and a new [`KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD`][3900] variable should be used instead. Also, [`module_conf_*`][3901] must now be used in conjunction with a new [`KERNEL_MODULE_PROBECONF`][3902] variable. The new variables no longer require you to specify the module name as part of the variable name. This change not only simplifies usage but also allows the values of these variables to be appropriately incorporated into task signatures and thus trigger the appropriate tasks to re-execute when changed. You should replace any references to `module_autoload_*` with`KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD`, and add any modules for which `module_conf_*` is specified to `KERNEL_MODULE_PROBECONF`.

For more information, see the [`KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD`][3903] and [`KERNEL_MODULE_PROBECONF`][3904] variables.

### 6.6.7. QA Check Changes[¶][515]

The following changes have occurred to the QA check process:

*   Additional QA checks `file-rdeps` and `build-deps` have been added in order to verify that file dependencies are satisfied (e.g. package contains a script requiring `/bin/bash`) and build-time dependencies are declared, respectively. For more information, please see the "[QA Error and Warning Messages][1059]" chapter.

*   Package QA checks are now performed during a new [`do_package_qa`][1060] task rather than being part of the [`do_package`][1061] task. This allows more parallel execution. This change is unlikely to be an issue except for highly customized recipes that disable packaging tasks themselves by marking them as `noexec`. For those packages, you will need to disable the `do_package_qa` task as well.

*   Files being overwritten during the [`do_populate_sysroot`][1062] task now trigger an error instead of a warning. Recipes should not be overwriting files written to the sysroot by other recipes. If you have these types of recipes, you need to alter them so that they do not overwrite these files.

    You might now receive this error after changes in configuration or metadata resulting in orphaned files being left in the sysroot. If you do receive this error, the way to resolve the issue is to delete your [`TMPDIR`][1063] or to move it out of the way and then re-start the build. Anything that has been fully built up to that point and does not need rebuilding will be restored from the shared state cache and the rest of the build will be able to proceed as normal.

### 6.6.8. Removed Recipes[¶][516]

The following recipes have been removed:

*   `x-load`: This recipe has been superseded by U-boot SPL for all Cortex-based TI SoCs. For legacy boards, the `meta-ti` layer, which contains a maintained recipe, should be used instead.

*   `ubootchart`: This recipe is obsolete. A `bootchart2` recipe has been added to functionally replace it.

*   `linux-yocto 3.4`: Support for the linux-yocto 3.4 kernel has been dropped. Support for the 3.10 and 3.14 kernels remains, while support for version 3.17 has been added.

*   `eglibc` has been removed in favor of `glibc`. See the "[`eglibc 2.19` Replaced with `glibc 2.20`][1064]" section for more information.

### 6.6.9. Miscellaneous Changes[¶][517]

The following miscellaneous change occurred:

*   The build history feature now writes `build-id.txt` instead of `build-id`. Additionally, `build-id.txt` now contains the full build header as printed by BitBake upon starting the build. You should manually remove old "build-id" files from your existing build history repositories to avoid confusion. For information on the build history feature, see the "[Maintaining Build Output Quality][1065]" section.

### 6.7. Moving to the Yocto Project 1.8 Release[¶][1066]

This section provides migration information for moving to the Yocto Project 1.8 Release from the prior release.

### 6.7.1. Removed Recipes[¶][518]

The following recipes have been removed:

*   `owl-video`: Functionality replaced by `gst-player`.

*   `gaku`: Functionality replaced by `gst-player`.

*   `gnome-desktop`: This recipe is now available in `meta-gnome` and is no longer needed.

*   `gsettings-desktop-schemas`: This recipe is now available in `meta-gnome` and is no longer needed.

*   `python-argparse`: The `argparse` module is already provided in the default Python distribution in a package named `python-argparse`. Consequently, the separate `python-argparse` recipe is no longer needed.

*   `telepathy-python, libtelepathy, telepathy-glib, telepathy-idle, telepathy-mission-control`: All these recipes have moved to `meta-oe`and are consequently no longer needed by any recipes in OpenEmbedded-Core.

*   `linux-yocto_3.10` and `linux-yocto_3.17`: Support for the linux-yocto 3.10 and 3.17 kernels has been dropped. Support for the 3.14 kernel remains, while support for 3.19 kernel has been added.

*   `poky-feed-config-opkg`: This recipe has become obsolete and is no longer needed. Use `distro-feed-config` from `meta-oe` instead.

*   `libav 0.8.x`: `libav 9.x` is now used.

*   `sed-native`: No longer needed. A working version of `sed` is expected to be provided by the host distribution.

### 6.7.2. BlueZ 4.x / 5.x Selection[¶][519]

Proper built-in support for selecting BlueZ 5.x in preference to the default of 4.x now exists. To use BlueZ 5.x, simply add "bluez5" to your[`DISTRO_FEATURES`][3905] value. If you had previously added append files (`*.bbappend`) to make this selection, you can now remove them.

Additionally, a [`bluetooth`][3906] class has been added to make selection of the appropriate bluetooth support within a recipe a little easier. If you wish to make use of this class in a recipe, add something such as the following:

```
     inherit bluetooth
     PACKAGECONFIG ??= "${@bb.utils.contains('DISTRO_FEATURES', 'bluetooth', '${BLUEZ}', '', d)}
     PACKAGECONFIG[bluez4] = "--enable-bluetooth,--disable-bluetooth,bluez4"
     PACKAGECONFIG[bluez5] = "--enable-bluez5,--disable-bluez5,bluez5"

```

### 6.7.3. Kernel Build Changes[¶][520]

The kernel build process was changed to place the source in a common shared work area and to place build artifacts separately in the source code tree. In theory, migration paths have been provided for most common usages in kernel recipes but this might not work in all cases. In particular, users need to ensure that `${S}` (source files) and `${B}` (build artifacts) are used correctly in functions such as [`do_configure`][3907] and [`do_install`][3908]. For kernel recipes that do not inherit from `kernel-yocto` or include `linux-yocto.inc`, you might wish to refer to the `linux.inc` file in the `meta-oe` layer for the kinds of changes you need to make. For reference, here is the [commit][3909] where the `linux.inc` file in `meta-oe` was updated.

Recipes that rely on the kernel source code and do not inherit the module classes might need to add explicit dependencies on the `do_shared_workdir`kernel task, for example:

```
     do_configure[depends] += "virtual/kernel:do_shared_workdir"

```

### 6.7.4. SSL 3.0 is Now Disabled in OpenSSL[¶][521]

SSL 3.0 is now disabled when building OpenSSL. Disabling SSL 3.0 avoids any lingering instances of the POODLE vulnerability. If you feel you must re-enable SSL 3.0, then you can add an append file (`*.bbappend`) for the `openssl` recipe to remove "-no-ssl3" from [`EXTRA_OECONF`][3910].

### 6.7.5. Default Sysroot Poisoning[¶][522]

`gcc's` default sysroot and include directories are now "poisoned". In other words, the sysroot and include directories are being redirected to a non-existent location in order to catch when host directories are being used due to the correct options not being passed. This poisoning applies both to the cross-compiler used within the build and to the cross-compiler produced in the SDK.

If this change causes something in the build to fail, it almost certainly means the various compiler flags and commands are not being passed correctly to the underlying piece of software. In such cases, you need to take corrective steps.

### 6.7.6. Rebuild Improvements[¶][523]

Changes have been made to the [`base`][3911], [`autotools`][3912], and [`cmake`][3913] classes to clean out generated files when the [`do_configure`][3914] task needs to be re-executed.

One of the improvements is to attempt to run "make clean" during the `do_configure` task if a `Makefile` exists. Some software packages do not provide a working clean target within their make files. If you have such recipes, you need to set [`CLEANBROKEN`][3915] to "1" within the recipe, for example:

```
     CLEANBROKEN = "1"

```

### 6.7.7. QA Check and Validation Changes[¶][524]

The following QA Check and Validation Changes have occurred:

*   Usage of `PRINC` previously triggered a warning. It now triggers an error. You should remove any remaining usage of `PRINC` in any recipe or append file.

*   An additional QA check has been added to detect usage of `${D}` in [`FILES`][1067] values where [`D`][1068] values should not be used at all. The same check ensures that `$D` is used in `pkg_preinst/pkg_postinst/pkg_prerm/pkg_postrm` functions instead of `${D}`.

*   [`S`][1069] now needs to be set to a valid value within a recipe. If `S` is not set in the recipe, the directory is not automatically created. If `S` does not point to a directory that exists at the time the [`do_unpack`][1070] task finishes, a warning will be shown.

*   [`LICENSE`][1071] is now validated for correct formatting of multiple licenses. If the format is invalid (e.g. multiple licenses are specified with no operators to specify how the multiple licenses interact), then a warning will be shown.

### 6.7.8. Miscellaneous Changes[¶][525]

The following miscellaneous changes have occurred:

*   The `send-error-report` script now expects a "-s" option to be specified before the server address. This assumes a server address is being specified.

*   The `oe-pkgdata-util` script now expects a "-p" option to be specified before the `pkgdata` directory, which is now optional. If the `pkgdata` directory is not specified, the script will run BitBake to query [`PKGDATA_DIR`][1072] from the build environment.

### 6.8. Moving to the Yocto Project 2.0 Release[¶][1073]

This section provides migration information for moving to the Yocto Project 2.0 Release from the prior release.

### 6.8.1. GCC 5[¶][526]

The default compiler is now GCC 5.2\. This change has required fixes for compilation errors in a number of other recipes.

One important example is a fix for when the Linux kernel freezes at boot time on ARM when built with GCC 5\. If you are using your own kernel recipe or source tree and building for ARM, you will likely need to apply this [patch][3916]. The standard `linux-yocto` kernel source tree already has a workaround for the same issue.

For further details, see [https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-5/changes.html][3917] and the porting guide at [https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-5/porting_to.html][3918].

Alternatively, you can switch back to GCC 4.9 or 4.8 by setting `GCCVERSION` in your configuration, as follows:

```
     GCCVERSION = "4.9%"

```

### 6.8.2. Gstreamer 0.10 Removed[¶][527]

Gstreamer 0.10 has been removed in favor of Gstreamer 1.x. As part of the change, recipes for Gstreamer 0.10 and related software are now located in `meta-multimedia`. This change results in Qt4 having Phonon and Gstreamer support in QtWebkit disabled by default.

### 6.8.3. Removed Recipes[¶][528]

The following recipes have been moved or removed:

*   `bluez4`: The recipe is obsolete and has been moved due to `bluez5` becoming fully integrated. The `bluez4` recipe now resides in `meta-oe`.

*   `gamin`: The recipe is obsolete and has been removed.

*   `gnome-icon-theme`: The recipe's functionally has been replaced by `adwaita-icon-theme`.

*   Gstreamer 0.10 Recipes: Recipes for Gstreamer 0.10 have been removed in favor of the recipes for Gstreamer 1.x.

*   `insserv`: The recipe is obsolete and has been removed.

*   `libunique`: The recipe is no longer used and has been moved to `meta-oe`.

*   `midori`: The recipe's functionally has been replaced by `epiphany`.

*   `python-gst`: The recipe is obsolete and has been removed since it only contains bindings for Gstreamer 0.10.

*   `qt-mobility`: The recipe is obsolete and has been removed since it requires `Gstreamer 0.10`, which has been replaced.

*   `subversion`: All 1.6.x versions of this recipe have been removed.

*   `webkit-gtk`: The older 1.8.3 version of this recipe has been removed in favor of `webkitgtk`.

### 6.8.4. BitBake datastore improvements[¶][529]

The method by which BitBake's datastore handles overrides has changed. Overrides are now applied dynamically and `bb.data.update_data()` is now a no-op. Thus, `bb.data.update_data()` is no longer required in order to apply the correct overrides. In practice, this change is unlikely to require any changes to Metadata. However, these minor changes in behavior exist:

*   All potential overrides are now visible in the variable history as seen when you run the following:

    ```
         $ bitbake -e

    ```

*   `d.delVar('` _`VARNAME`_ `')` and `d.setVar('` _`VARNAME`_ `', None)` result in the variable and all of its overrides being cleared out. Before the change, only the non-overridden values were cleared.

### 6.8.5. Shell Message Function Changes[¶][530]

The shell versions of the BitBake message functions (i.e. `bbdebug`, `bbnote`, `bbwarn`, `bbplain`, `bberror`, and `bbfatal`) are now connected through to their BitBake equivalents `bb.debug()`, `bb.note()`, `bb.warn()`, `bb.plain()`, `bb.error()`, and `bb.fatal()`, respectively. Thus, those message functions that you would expect to be printed by the BitBake UI are now actually printed. In practice, this change means two things:

*   If you now see messages on the console that you did not previously see as a result of this change, you might need to clean up the calls to `bbwarn`, `bberror`, and so forth. Or, you might want to simply remove the calls.

*   The `bbfatal` message function now suppresses the full error log in the UI, which means any calls to `bbfatal` where you still wish to see the full error log should be replaced by `die` or `bbfatal_log`.

### 6.8.6. Extra Development/Debug Package Cleanup[¶][531]

The following recipes have had extra `dev/dbg` packages removed:

*   `acl`

*   `apmd`

*   `aspell`

*   `attr`

*   `augeas`

*   `bzip2`

*   `cogl`

*   `curl`

*   `elfutils`

*   `gcc-target`

*   `libgcc`

*   `libtool`

*   `libxmu`

*   `opkg`

*   `pciutils`

*   `rpm`

*   `sysfsutils`

*   `tiff`

*   `xz`

All of the above recipes now conform to the standard packaging scheme where a single `-dev`, `-dbg`, and `-staticdev` package exists per recipe.

### 6.8.7. Recipe Maintenance Tracking Data Moved to OE-Core[¶][532]

Maintenance tracking data for recipes that was previously part of `meta-yocto` has been moved to OE-Core. The change includes `package_regex.inc`and `distro_alias.inc`, which are typically enabled when using the [`distrodata`][3919] class. Additionally, the contents of `upstream_tracking.inc` has now been split out to the relevant recipes.

### 6.8.8. Automatic Stale Sysroot File Cleanup[¶][533]

Stale files from recipes that no longer exist in the current configuration are now automatically removed from sysroot as well as removed from any other place managed by shared state. This automatic cleanup means that the build system now properly handles situations such as renaming the build system side of recipes, removal of layers from `bblayers.conf`, and [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][3920] changes.

Additionally, work directories for old versions of recipes are now pruned. If you wish to disable pruning old work directories, you can set the following variable in your configuration:

```
     SSTATE_PRUNE_OBSOLETEWORKDIR = "0"

```

### 6.8.9. `linux-yocto` Kernel Metadata Repository Now Split from Source[¶][534]

The `linux-yocto` tree has up to now been a combined set of kernel changes and configuration (meta) data carried in a single tree. While this format is effective at keeping kernel configuration and source modifications synchronized, it is not always obvious to developers how to manipulate the Metadata as compared to the source.

Metadata processing has now been removed from the [`kernel-yocto`][3921] class and the external Metadata repository `yocto-kernel-cache`, which has always been used to seed the `linux-yocto` "meta" branch. This separate `linux-yocto` cache repository is now the primary location for this data. Due to this change, `linux-yocto` is no longer able to process combined trees. Thus, if you need to have your own combined kernel repository, you must do the split there as well and update your recipes accordingly. See the `meta/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto_4.1.bb` recipe for an example.

### 6.8.10. Additional QA checks[¶][535]

The following QA checks have been added:

*   Added a "host-user-contaminated" check for ownership issues for packaged files outside of `/home`. The check looks for files that are incorrectly owned by the user that ran BitBake instead of owned by a valid user in the target system.

*   Added an "invalid-chars" check for invalid (non-UTF8) characters in recipe metadata variable values (i.e. [`DESCRIPTION`][1074], [`SUMMARY`][1075], [`LICENSE`][1076], and[`SECTION`][1077]). Some package managers do not support these characters.

*   Added an "invalid-packageconfig" check for any options specified in [`PACKAGECONFIG`][1078] that do not match any `PACKAGECONFIG` option defined for the recipe.

### 6.8.11. Miscellaneous Changes[¶][536]

These additional changes exist:

*   `gtk-update-icon-cache` has been renamed to `gtk-icon-utils`.

*   The `tools-profile` [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][1079] item as well as its corresponding packagegroup and `packagegroup-core-tools-profile` no longer bring in `oprofile`. Bringing in `oprofile` was originally added to aid compilation on resource-constrained targets. However, this aid has not been widely used and is not likely to be used going forward due to the more powerful target platforms and the existence of better cross-compilation tools.

*   The [`IMAGE_FSTYPES`][1080] variable's default value now specifies `ext4` instead of `ext3`.

*   All support for the `PRINC` variable has been removed.

*   The `packagegroup-core-full-cmdline` packagegroup no longer brings in `lighttpd` due to the fact that bringing in `lighttpd` is not really in line with the packagegroup's purpose, which is to add full versions of command-line tools that by default are provided by `busybox`.

### 6.9. Moving to the Yocto Project 2.1 Release[¶][1081]

This section provides migration information for moving to the Yocto Project 2.1 Release from the prior release.

### 6.9.1. Variable Expansion in Python Functions[¶][537]

Variable expressions, such as `${` _`VARNAME`_ `}` no longer expand automatically within Python functions. Suppressing expansion was done to allow Python functions to construct shell scripts or other code for situations in which you do not want such expressions expanded. For any existing code that relies on these expansions, you need to change the expansions to expand the value of individual variables through `d.getVar()`. To alternatively expand more complex expressions, use `d.expand()`.

### 6.9.2. Overrides Must Now be Lower-Case[¶][538]

The convention for overrides has always been for them to be lower-case characters. This practice is now a requirement as BitBake's datastore now assumes lower-case characters in order to give a slight performance boost during parsing. In practical terms, this requirement means that anything that ends up in [`OVERRIDES`][3922] must now appear in lower-case characters (e.g. values for `MACHINE`, `TARGET_ARCH`, `DISTRO`, and also recipe names if `_pn-` _`recipename`_  overrides are to be effective).

### 6.9.3. Expand Parameter to `getVar()` and `getVarFlag()` is Now Mandatory[¶][539]

The expand parameter to `getVar()` and `getVarFlag()` previously defaulted to False if not specified. Now, however, no default exists so one must be specified. You must change any `getVar()` calls that do not specify the final expand parameter to calls that do specify the parameter. You can run the following `sed` command at the base of a layer to make this change:

```
     sed -e 's:\(\.getVar([^,()]*\)):\1, False):g' -i `grep -ril getVar *`
     sed -e 's:\(\.getVarFlag([^,()]*, [^,()]*\)):\1, False):g' -i `grep -ril getVarFlag *`

```

### Note

The reason for this change is that it prepares the way for changing the default to True in a future Yocto Project release. This future change is a much more sensible default than False. However, the change needs to be made gradually as a sudden change of the default would potentially cause side-effects that would be difficult to detect.

### 6.9.4. Makefile Environment Changes[¶][540]

[`EXTRA_OEMAKE`][3923] now defaults to "" instead of "-e MAKEFLAGS=". Setting `EXTRA_OEMAKE` to "-e MAKEFLAGS=" by default was a historical accident that has required many classes (e.g. `autotools`, `module`) and recipes to override this default in order to work with sensible build systems. When upgrading to the release, you must edit any recipe that relies upon this old default by either setting `EXTRA_OEMAKE` back to "-e MAKEFLAGS=" or by explicitly setting any required variable value overrides using `EXTRA_OEMAKE`, which is typically only needed when a Makefile sets a default value for a variable that is inappropriate for cross-compilation using the "=" operator rather than the "?=" operator.

### 6.9.5. `libexecdir` Reverted to `${prefix}/libexec`[¶][541]

The use of `${libdir}/${BPN}` as `libexecdir` is different as compared to all other mainstream distributions, which either uses `${prefix}/libexec` or`${libdir}`. The use is also contrary to the GNU Coding Standards (i.e. [https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Directory-Variables.html][3924]) that suggest `${prefix}/libexec` and also notes that any package-specific nesting should be done by the package itself. Finally, having `libexecdir` change between recipes makes it very difficult for different recipes to invoke binaries that have been installed into `libexecdir`. The Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (i.e. [http://refspecs.linuxfoundation.org/FHS_3.0/fhs/ch04s07.html][3925]) now recognizes the use of `${prefix}/libexec/`, giving distributions the choice between `${prefix}/lib` or `${prefix}/libexec` without breaking FHS.

### 6.9.6. `ac_cv_sizeof_off_t` is No Longer Cached in Site Files[¶][542]

For recipes inheriting the [`autotools`][3926] class, `ac_cv_sizeof_off_t` is no longer cached in the site files for `autoconf`. The reason for this change is because the `ac_cv_sizeof_off_t` value is not necessarily static per architecture as was previously assumed. Rather, the value changes based on whether large file support is enabled. For most software that uses `autoconf`, this change should not be a problem. However, if you have a recipe that bypasses the standard [`do_configure`][3927] task from the `autotools` class and the software the recipe is building uses a very old version of `autoconf`, the recipe might be incapable of determining the correct size of `off_t` during `do_configure`.

The best course of action is to patch the software as necessary to allow the default implementation from the `autotools` class to work such that`autoreconf` succeeds and produces a working configure script, and to remove the overridden `do_configure` task such that the default implementation does get used.

### 6.9.7. Image Generation is Now Split Out from Filesystem Generation[¶][543]

Previously, for image recipes the [`do_rootfs`][3928] task assembled the filesystem and then from that filesystem generated images. With this Yocto Project release, image generation is split into separate [`do_image_*`][3929] tasks for clarity both in operation and in the code.

For most cases, this change does not present any problems. However, if you have made customizations that directly modify the `do_rootfs` task or that mention `do_rootfs`, you might need to update those changes. In particular, if you had added any tasks after `do_rootfs`, you should make edits so that those tasks are after the [`do_image_complete`][3930] task rather than after `do_rootfs` so that the your added tasks run at the correct time.

A minor part of this restructuring is that the post-processing definitions and functions have been moved from the [`image`][3931] class to the [`rootfs-postcommands`][3932] class. Functionally, however, they remain unchanged.

### 6.9.8. Removed Recipes[¶][544]

The following recipes have been removed in the 2.1 release:

*   `gcc` version 4.8: Versions 4.9 and 5.3 remain.

*   `qt4`: All support for Qt 4.x has been moved out to a separate `meta-qt4` layer because Qt 4 is no longer supported upstream.

*   `x11vnc`: Moved to the `meta-oe` layer.

*   `linux-yocto-3.14`: No longer supported.

*   `linux-yocto-3.19`: No longer supported.

*   `libjpeg`: Replaced by the `libjpeg-turbo` recipe.

*   `pth`: Became obsolete.

*   `liboil`: Recipe is no longer needed and has been moved to the `meta-multimedia` layer.

*   `gtk-theme-torturer`: Recipe is no longer needed and has been moved to the `meta-gnome` layer.

*   `gnome-mime-data`: Recipe is no longer needed and has been moved to the `meta-gnome` layer.

*   `udev`: Replaced by the `eudev` recipe for compatibility when using `sysvinit` with newer kernels.

*   `python-pygtk`: Recipe became obsolete.

*   `adt-installer`: Recipe became obsolete. See the "[ADT Removed][1082]" section for more information.

### 6.9.9. Class Changes[¶][545]

The following classes have changed:

*   `autotools_stage`: Removed because the [`autotools`][1083] class now provides its functionality. Recipes that inherited from `autotools_stage` should now inherit from `autotools` instead.

*   `boot-directdisk`: Merged into the [`image-vm`][1084] class. The `boot-directdisk` class was rarely directly used. Consequently, this change should not cause any issues.

*   `bootimg`: Merged into the [`image-live`][1085] class. The `bootimg` class was rarely directly used. Consequently, this change should not cause any issues.

*   `packageinfo`: Removed due to its limited use by the Hob UI, which has itself been removed.

### 6.9.10. Build System User Interface Changes[¶][546]

The following changes have been made to the build system user interface:

*   _Hob GTK+-based UI_ : Removed because it is unmaintained and based on the outdated GTK+ 2 library. The Toaster web-based UI is much more capable and is actively maintained. See the "[Using the Toaster Web Interface][1086]" section in the Yocto Project Toaster User Manual for more information on this interface.

*   _"puccho" BitBake UI_ : Removed because is unmaintained and no longer useful.

### 6.9.11. ADT Removed[¶][547]

The Application Development Toolkit (ADT) has been removed because its functionality almost completely overlapped with the [standard SDK][3933] and the[extensible SDK][3934]. For information on these SDKs and how to build and use them, see the [Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK) Developer's Guide][3935].

### Note

The Yocto Project Eclipse IDE Plug-in is still supported and is not affected by this change.

### 6.9.12. Poky Reference Distribution Changes[¶][548]

The following changes have been made for the Poky distribution:

*   The `meta-yocto` layer has been renamed to `meta-poky` to better match its purpose, which is to provide the Poky reference distribution. The `meta-yocto-bsp` layer retains its original name since it provides reference machines for the Yocto Project and it is otherwise unrelated to Poky. References to `meta-yocto` in your `conf/bblayers.conf` should automatically be updated, so you should not need to change anything unless you are relying on this naming elsewhere.

*   The [`uninative`][1087] class is now enabled by default in Poky. This class attempts to isolate the build system from the host distribution's C library and makes re-use of native shared state artifacts across different host distributions practical. With this class enabled, a tarball containing a pre-built C library is downloaded at the start of the build.

    The `uninative` class is enabled through the `meta/conf/distro/include/yocto-uninative.inc` file, which for those not using the Poky distribution, can include to easily enable the same functionality.

    Alternatively, if you wish to build your own `uninative` tarball, you can do so by building the `uninative-tarball` recipe, making it available to your build machines (e.g. over HTTP/HTTPS) and setting a similar configuration as the one set by `yocto-uninative.inc`.

*   Static library generation, for most cases, is now disabled by default in the Poky distribution. Disabling this generation saves some build time as well as the size used for build output artifacts.

    Disabling this library generation is accomplished through a `meta/conf/distro/include/no-static-libs.inc`, which for those not using the Poky distribution can easily include to enable the same functionality.

    Any recipe that needs to opt-out of having the "--disable-static" option specified on the configure command line either because it is not a supported option for the configure script or because static libraries are needed should set the following variable:

    ```
         DISABLE_STATIC = ""

    ```

*   The separate `poky-tiny` distribution now uses the musl C library instead of a heavily pared down `glibc`. Using musl results in a smaller distribution and facilitates much greater maintainability because musl is designed to have a small footprint.

    If you have used `poky-tiny` and have customized the `glibc` configuration you will need to redo those customizations with musl when upgrading to the new release.

### 6.9.13. Packaging Changes[¶][549]

The following changes have been made to packaging:

*   The `runuser` and `mountpoint` binaries, which were previously in the main `util-linux` package, have been split out into the `util-linux-runuser`and `util-linux-mountpoint` packages, respectively.

*   The `python-elementtree` package has been merged into the `python-xml` package.

### 6.9.14. Tuning File Changes[¶][550]

The following changes have been made to the tuning files:

*   The "no-thumb-interwork" tuning feature has been dropped from the ARM tune include files. Because interworking is required for ARM EABI, attempting to disable it through a tuning feature no longer makes sense.

    ### Note

    Support for ARM OABI was deprecated in gcc 4.7.

*   The `tune-cortexm*.inc` and `tune-cortexr4.inc` files have been removed because they are poorly tested. Until the OpenEmbedded build system officially gains support for CPUs without an MMU, these tuning files would probably be better maintained in a separate layer if needed.

### 6.9.15. Supporting GObject Introspection[¶][551]

This release supports generation of GLib Introspective Repository (GIR) files through GObject introspection, which is the standard mechanism for accessing GObject-based software from runtime environments. You can enable, disable, and test the generation of this data. See the "[Enabling GObject Introspection Support][3936]" section for more information.

### 6.9.16. Miscellaneous Changes[¶][552]

These additional changes exist:

*   The minimum Git version has been increased to 1.8.3.1\. If your host distribution does not provide a sufficiently recent version, you can install the buildtools, which will provide it. See the "[Required Git, tar, and Python Versions][1088]" section for more information on the buildtools tarball.

*   The buggy and incomplete support for the RPM version 4 package manager has been removed. The well-tested and maintained support for RPM version 5 remains.

*   Previously, the following list of packages were removed if package-management was not in [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][1089], regardless of any dependencies:

    ```
         update-rc.d
         base-passwd
         shadow
         update-alternatives
         run-postinsts

    ```

    With the Yocto Project 2.1 release, these packages are only removed if "read-only-rootfs" is in `IMAGE_FEATURES`, since they might still be needed for a read-write image even in the absence of a package manager (e.g. if users need to be added, modified, or removed at runtime).

*   The [`devtool modify`][1090] command now defaults to extracting the source since that is most commonly expected. The "-x" or "--extract" options are now no-ops. If you wish to provide your own existing source tree, you will now need to specify either the "-n" or "--no-extract" options when running`devtool modify`.

*   If the formfactor for a machine is either not supplied or does not specify whether a keyboard is attached, then the default is to assume a keyboard is attached rather than assume no keyboard. This change primarily affects the Sato UI.

*   The `.debug` directory packaging is now automatic. If your recipe builds software that installs binaries into directories other than the standard ones, you no longer need to take care of setting `FILES_${PN}-dbg` to pick up the resulting `.debug` directories as these directories are automatically found and added.

*   Inaccurate disk and CPU percentage data has been dropped from `buildstats` output. This data has been replaced with `getrusage()` data and corrected IO statistics. You will probably need to update any custom code that reads the `buildstats` data.

*   The `meta/conf/distro/include/package_regex.inc` is now deprecated. The contents of this file have been moved to individual recipes.

    ### Tip

    Because this file will likely be removed in a future Yocto Project release, it is suggested that you remove any references to the file that might be in your configuration.

*   The `v86d/uvesafb` has been removed from the `genericx86` and `genericx86-64` reference machines, which are provided by the `meta-yocto-bsp`layer. Most modern x86 boards do not rely on this file and it only adds kernel error messages during startup. If you do still need to support `uvesafb`, you can simply add `v86d` to your image.

*   Build sysroot paths are now removed from debug symbol files. Removing these paths means that remote GDB using an unstripped build system sysroot will no longer work (although this was never documented to work). The supported method to accomplish something similar is to set `IMAGE_GEN_DEBUGFS` to "1", which will generate a companion debug image containing unstripped binaries and associated debug sources alongside the image.

### 6.10. Moving to the Yocto Project 2.2 Release[¶][1091]

This section provides migration information for moving to the Yocto Project 2.2 Release from the prior release.

### 6.10.1. Minimum Kernel Version[¶][553]

The minimum kernel version for the target system and for SDK is now 3.2.0, due to the upgrade to `glibc 2.24`. Specifically, for AArch64-based targets the version is 3.14\. For Nios II-based targets, the minimum kernel version is 3.19.

### Note

For x86 and x86_64, you can reset [`OLDEST_KERNEL`][3937] to anything down to 2.6.32 if desired.

### 6.10.2. Staging Directories in Sysroot Has Been Simplified[¶][554]

The way directories are staged in sysroot has been simplified and introduces the new [`SYSROOT_DIRS`][3938], [`SYSROOT_DIRS_NATIVE`][3939], and[`SYSROOT_DIRS_BLACKLIST`][3940]. See the [v2 patch series on the OE-Core Mailing List][3941] for additional information.

### 6.10.3. Removal of Old Images and Other Files in `tmp/deploy` Now Enabled[¶][555]

Removal of old images and other files in `tmp/deploy/` is now enabled by default due to a new staging method used for those files. As a result of this change, the `RM_OLD_IMAGE` variable is now redundant.

### 6.10.4. Python Changes[¶][556]

The following changes for Python occurred:

#### 6.10.4.1. BitBake Now Requires Python 3.4+[¶][58]

BitBake requires Python 3.4 or greater.

#### 6.10.4.2. UTF-8 Locale Required on Build Host[¶][59]

A UTF-8 locale is required on the build host due to Python 3\. Since C.UTF-8 is not a standard, the default is en_US.UTF-8.

#### 6.10.4.3. Metadata Must Now Use Python 3 Syntax[¶][60]

The metadata is now required to use Python 3 syntax. For help preparing metadata, see any of the many Python 3 porting guides available. Alternatively, you can reference the conversion commits for Bitbake and you can use OE-Core as a guide for changes. Following are particular areas of interest:

```
     * subprocess command-line pipes needing locale decoding
     * the syntax for octal values changed
     * the iter*() functions changed name
     * iterators now return views, not lists
     * changed names for Python modules

```

#### 6.10.4.4. Target Python Recipes Switched to Python 3[¶][61]

Most target Python recipes have now been switched to Python 3\. Unfortunately, systems using RPM as a package manager and providing online package-manager support through SMART still require Python 2.

### Note

Python 2 and recipes that use it can still be built for the target as with previous versions.

#### 6.10.4.5. `buildtools-tarball` Includes Python 3[¶][62]

`buildtools-tarball` now includes Python 3.

### 6.10.5. uClibc Replaced by musl[¶][557]

uClibc has been removed in favor of musl. Musl has matured, is better maintained, and is compatible with a wider range of applications as compared to uClibc.

### 6.10.6. `${B}` No Longer Default Working Directory for Tasks[¶][558]

`${`[`B`][3942]`}` is no longer the default working directory for tasks. Consequently, any custom tasks you define now need to either have the `[`[`dirs`][3943]`]` flag set, or the task needs to change into the appropriate working directory manually (e.g using `cd` for a shell task).

### Note

The preferred method is to use the `[dirs]` flag.

### 6.10.7. `runqemu` Ported to Python[¶][559]

`runqemu` has been ported to Python and has changed behavior in some cases. Previous usage patterns continue to be supported.

The new `runqemu` is a Python script. Machine knowledge is no longer hardcoded into `runqemu`. You can choose to use the `qemuboot` configuration file to define the BSP's own arguments and to make it bootable with `runqemu`. If you use a configuration file, use the following form:

```
     image-name-machine.qemuboot.conf

```

The configuration file enables fine-grained tuning of options passed to QEMU without the `runqemu` script hard-coding any knowledge about different machines. Using a configuration file is particularly convenient when trying to use QEMU with machines other than the `qemu*` machines in OE-Core. The `qemuboot.conf` file is generated by the `qemuboot` class when the root filesystem is being build (i.e. build rootfs). QEMU boot arguments can be set in BSP's configuration file and the `qemuboot` class will save them to `qemuboot.conf`.

If you want to use `runqemu` without a configuration file, use the following command form:

```
     $ runqemu machine rootfs kernel [options]

```

Supported  _`machines`_  are as follows:

```
     qemuarm
     qemuarm64
     qemux86
     qemux86-64
     qemuppc
     qemumips
     qemumips64
     qemumipsel
     qemumips64el

```

Consider the following example, which uses the `qemux86-64` machine, provides a root filesystem, provides an image, and uses the `nographic` option:

```
$ runqemu qemux86-64 tmp/deploy/images/qemux86-64/core-image-minimal-qemux86-64.ext4 tmp/deploy/images/qemux86-64/bzImage nographic

```

Following is a list of variables that can be set in configuration files such as `bsp.conf` to enable the BSP to be booted by `runqemu`:

### Note

"QB" means "QEMU Boot".
```
     QB_SYSTEM_NAME: QEMU name (e.g. "qemu-system-i386")
     QB_OPT_APPEND: Options to append to QEMU (e.g. "-show-cursor")
     QB_DEFAULT_KERNEL: Default kernel to boot (e.g. "bzImage")
     QB_DEFAULT_FSTYPE: Default FSTYPE to boot (e.g. "ext4")
     QB_MEM: Memory (e.g. "-m 512")
     QB_MACHINE: QEMU machine (e.g. "-machine virt")
     QB_CPU: QEMU cpu (e.g. "-cpu qemu32")
     QB_CPU_KVM: Similar to QB_CPU except used for kvm support (e.g. "-cpu kvm64")
     QB_KERNEL_CMDLINE_APPEND: Options to append to the kernel's -append
                               option (e.g. "console=ttyS0 console=tty")
     QB_DTB: QEMU dtb name
     QB_AUDIO_DRV: QEMU audio driver (e.g. "alsa", set it when support audio)
     QB_AUDIO_OPT: QEMU audio option (e.g. "-soundhw ac97,es1370"), which is used
                   when QB_AUDIO_DRV is set.
     QB_KERNEL_ROOT: Kernel's root (e.g. /dev/vda)
     QB_TAP_OPT: Network option for 'tap' mode (e.g.
                 "-netdev tap,id=net0,ifname=@TAP@,script=no,downscript=no -device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0").
                  runqemu will replace "@TAP@" with the one that is used, such as tap0, tap1 ...
     QB_SLIRP_OPT: Network option for SLIRP mode (e.g. "-netdev user,id=net0 -device virtio-net-device,netdev=net0")
     QB_ROOTFS_OPT: Used as rootfs (e.g.
                    "-drive id=disk0,file=@ROOTFS@,if=none,format=raw -device virtio-blk-device,drive=disk0").
                    runqemu will replace "@ROOTFS@" with the one which is used, such as
                    core-image-minimal-qemuarm64.ext4.
     QB_SERIAL_OPT: Serial port (e.g. "-serial mon:stdio")
     QB_TCPSERIAL_OPT: tcp serial port option (e.g.
                       " -device virtio-serial-device -chardev socket,id=virtcon,port=@PORT@,host=127.0.0.1 -device      virtconsole,chardev=virtcon"
                       runqemu will replace "@PORT@" with the port number which is used.

```

To use `runqemu`, set [`IMAGE_CLASSES`][3944] as follows and run `runqemu`:

### Note

For command-line syntax, use `runqemu help`.
```
     IMAGE_CLASSES += "qemuboot"

```

### 6.10.8. Default Linker Hash Style Changed[¶][560]

The default linker hash style for `gcc-cross` is now "sysv" in order to catch recipes that are building software without using the OpenEmbedded[`LDFLAGS`][3945]. This change could result in seeing some "No GNU_HASH in the elf binary" QA issues when building such recipes. You need to fix these recipes so that they use the expected `LDFLAGS`. Depending on how the software is built, the build system used by the software (e.g. a Makefile) might need to be patched. However, sometimes making this fix is as simple as adding the following to the recipe:

```
     TARGET_CC_ARCH += "${LDFLAGS}"

```

### 6.10.9. `KERNEL_IMAGE_BASE_NAME` no Longer Uses `KERNEL_IMAGETYPE`[¶][561]

The [`KERNEL_IMAGE_BASE_NAME`][3946] variable no longer uses the [`KERNEL_IMAGETYPE`][3947] variable to create the image's base name. Because the OpenEmbedded build system can now build multiple kernel image types, this part of the kernel image base name as been removed leaving only the following:

```
     KERNEL_IMAGE_BASE_NAME ?= "${PKGE}-${PKGV}-${PKGR}-${MACHINE}-${DATETIME}

```

If you have recipes or classes that use `KERNEL_IMAGE_BASE_NAME` directly, you might need to update the references to ensure they continue to work.

### 6.10.10. BitBake Changes[¶][562]

The following changes took place for BitBake:

*   The "goggle" UI and standalone image-writer tool have been removed as they both require GTK+ 2.0 and were not being maintained.

*   The Perforce fetcher now supports [`SRCREV`][1092] for specifying the source revision to use, be it `${`[`AUTOREV`][1093]`}`, changelist number, p4date, or label, in preference to separate [`SRC_URI`][1094] parameters to specify these. This change is more in-line with how the other fetchers work for source control systems. Recipes that fetch from Perforce will need to be updated to use `SRCREV` in place of specifying the source revision within `SRC_URI`.

*   Some of BitBake's internal code structures for accessing the recipe cache needed to be changed to support the new multi-configuration functionality. These changes will affect external tools that use BitBake's tinfoil module. For information on these changes, see the changes made to the scripts supplied with OpenEmbedded-Core: [1][1095] and [2][1096].

*   The task management code has been rewritten to avoid using ID indirection in order to improve performance. This change is unlikely to cause any problems for most users. However, the setscene verification function as pointed to by `BB_SETSCENE_VERIFY_FUNCTION` needed to change signature. Consequently, a new variable named `BB_SETSCENE_VERIFY_FUNCTION2` has been added allowing multiple versions of BitBake to work with suitably written metadata, which includes OpenEmbedded-Core and Poky. Anyone with custom BitBake task scheduler code might also need to update the code to handle the new structure.

### 6.10.11. Swabber has Been Removed[¶][563]

Swabber, a tool that was intended to detect host contamination in the build process, has been removed, as it has been unmaintained and unused for some time and was never particularly effective. The OpenEmbedded build system has since incorporated a number of mechanisms including enhanced QA checks that mean that there is less of a need for such a tool.

### 6.10.12. Removed Recipes[¶][564]

The following recipes have been removed:

*   `augeas`: No longer needed and has been moved to `meta-oe`.

*   `directfb`: Unmaintained and has been moved to `meta-oe`.

*   `gcc`: Removed 4.9 version. Versions 5.4 and 6.2 are still present.

*   `gnome-doc-utils`: No longer needed.

*   `gtk-doc-stub`: Replaced by `gtk-doc`.

*   `gtk-engines`: No longer needed and has been moved to `meta-gnome`.

*   `gtk-sato-engine`: Became obsolete.

*   `libglade`: No longer needed and has been moved to `meta-oe`.

*   `libmad`: Unmaintained and functionally replaced by `libmpg123`. `libmad` has been moved to `meta-oe`.

*   `libowl`: Became obsolete.

*   `libxsettings-client`: No longer needed.

*   `oh-puzzles`: Functionally replaced by `puzzles`.

*   `oprofileui`: Became obsolete. OProfile has been largely supplanted by perf.

*   `packagegroup-core-directfb.bb`: Removed.

*   `core-image-directfb.bb`: Removed.

*   `pointercal`: No longer needed and has been moved to `meta-oe`.

*   `python-imaging`: No longer needed and moved to `meta-python`

*   `python-pyrex`: No longer needed and moved to `meta-python`.

*   `sato-icon-theme`: Became obsolete.

*   `swabber-native`: Swabber has been removed. See the [entry on Swabber][1097].

*   `tslib`: No longer needed and has been moved to `meta-oe`.

*   `uclibc`: Removed in favor of musl.

*   `xtscal`: No longer needed and moved to `meta-oe`

### 6.10.13. Removed Classes[¶][565]

The following classes have been removed:

*   `distutils-native-base`: No longer needed.

*   `distutils3-native-base`: No longer needed.

*   `sdl`: Only set [`DEPENDS`][1098] and [`SECTION`][1099], which are better set within the recipe instead.

*   `sip`: Mostly unused.

*   `swabber`: See the [entry on Swabber][1100].

### 6.10.14. Minor Packaging Changes[¶][566]

The following minor packaging changes have occurred:

*   `grub`: Split `grub-editenv` into its own package.

*   `systemd`: Split container and vm related units into a new package, systemd-container.

*   `util-linux`: Moved `prlimit` to a separate `util-linux-prlimit` package.

### 6.10.15. Miscellaneous Changes[¶][567]

The following miscellaneous changes have occurred:

*   `package_regex.inc`: Removed because the definitions `package_regex.inc` previously contained have been moved to their respective recipes.

*   Both `devtool add` and `recipetool create` now use a fixed [`SRCREV`][1101] by default when fetching from a Git repository. You can override this in either case to use `${`[`AUTOREV`][1102]`}` instead by using the `-a` or `‐‐autorev` command-line option

*   `distcc`: GTK+ UI is now disabled by default.

*   `packagegroup-core-tools-testapps`: Removed Piglit.

*   `image.bbclass`: Renamed COMPRESS(ION) to CONVERSION. This change means that `COMPRESSIONTYPES`, `COMPRESS_DEPENDS` and `COMPRESS_CMD` are deprecated in favor of `CONVERSIONTYPES`, `CONVERSION_DEPENDS` and `CONVERSION_CMD`. The `COMPRESS*` variable names will still work in the 2.2 release but metadata that does not need to be backwards-compatible should be changed to use the new names as the `COMPRESS*` ones will be removed in a future release.

*   `gtk-doc`: A full version of `gtk-doc` is now made available. However, some old software might not be capable of using the current version of `gtk-doc`to build documentation. You need to change recipes that build such software so that they explicitly disable building documentation with `gtk-doc`.

### 6.11. Moving to the Yocto Project 2.3 Release[¶][1103]

This section provides migration information for moving to the Yocto Project 2.3 Release from the prior release.

### 6.11.1. Recipe-specific Sysroots[¶][568]

The Open-Embedded build system now uses one sysroot per recipe to resolve long-standing issues with configuration script auto-detection of undeclared dependencies. Consequently, you might find that some of your previously written custom recipes are missing declared dependencies, particularly those dependencies that are incidentally built earlier in a typical build process and thus are already likely to be present in the shared sysroot in previous releases.

Consider the following:

*   _Declare Build-Time Dependencies:_  Because of this new feature, you must explicitly declare all build-time dependencies for your recipe. If you do not declare these dependencies, they are not populated into the sysroot for the recipe.

*   _Specify Pre-Installation and Post-Installation Native Tool Dependencies:_  You must specifically specify any special native tool dependencies of `pkg_preinst` and `pkg_postinst` scripts by using the [`PACKAGE_WRITE_DEPS`][1104] variable. Specifying these dependencies ensures that these tools are available if these scripts need to be run on the build host during the [`do_rootfs`][1105] task.

    As an example, see the `dbus` recipe. You will see that this recipe has a `pkg_postinst` that calls `systemctl` if "systemd" is in [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][1106]. In the example, `systemd-systemctl-native` is added to `PACKAGE_WRITE_DEPS`, which is also conditional on "systemd" being in `DISTRO_FEATURES`.

*   _Examine Recipes that Use `SSTATEPOSTINSTFUNCS`:_  You need to examine any recipe that uses `SSTATEPOSTINSTFUNCS` and determine steps to take.

    Functions added to `SSTATEPOSTINSTFUNCS` are still called as they were in previous Yocto Project releases. However, since a separate sysroot is now being populated for every recipe and if existing functions being called through `SSTATEPOSTINSTFUNCS` are doing relocation, then you will need to change these to use a post-installation script that is installed by a function added to [`SYSROOT_PREPROCESS_FUNCS`][1107].

    For an example, see the `pixbufcache` class in `meta/classes/` in the Yocto Project [Source Repositories][1108].

    ### Note

    The `SSTATEPOSTINSTFUNCS` variable itself is now deprecated in favor of the `do_populate_sysroot[postfuncs]` task. Consequently, if you do still have any function or functions that need to be called after the sysroot component is created for a recipe, then you would be well advised to take steps to use a post installation script as described previously. Taking these steps prepares your code for when `SSTATEPOSTINSTFUNCS` is removed in a future Yocto Project release.

*   _Specify Which `STAGING_DIR_NATIVE` is Used:_  Because the shared sysroot is now gone, the scripts `oe-find-native-sysroot` and `oe-run-native`have been changed such that you need to specify which recipe's [`STAGING_DIR_NATIVE`][1109] is used.

### Note

You can find more information on how recipe-specific sysroots work in the "[`staging.bbclass`][3948]" section.

### 6.11.2. `PATH` Variable[¶][569]

Within the environment used to run build tasks, the environment variable `PATH` is now sanitized such that the normal native binary paths (`/bin`, `/sbin`,`/usr/bin` and so forth) are removed and a directory containing symbolic links linking only to the binaries from the host mentioned in the [`HOSTTOOLS`][3949]and [`HOSTTOOLS_NONFATAL`][3950] variables is added to `PATH`.

Consequently, any native binaries provided by the host that you need to call needs to be in one of these two variables at the configuration level.

Alternatively, you can add a native recipe (i.e. `-native`) that provides the binary to the recipe's [`DEPENDS`][3951] value.

### Note

`PATH` is not sanitized in the same way within `devshell`. If it were, you would have difficulty running host tools for development and debugging within the shell.

### 6.11.3. Changes to Scripts[¶][570]

The following changes to scripts took place:

*   _`oe-find-native-sysroot`:_  The usage for the `oe-find-native-sysroot` script has changed to the following:

    ```
         $ . oe-find-native-sysroot recipe

    ```

    You must now supply a recipe for  _`recipe`_  as part of the command. Prior to the Yocto Project 2.3 release, it was not necessary to provide the script with the command.

*   _`oe-run-native`:_  The usage for the `oe-run-native` script has changed to the following:

    ```
         $ oe-run-native native_recipe tool

    ```

    You must supply the name of the native recipe and the tool you want to run as part of the command. Prior to the Yocto Project 2.3 release, it was not necessary to provide the native recipe with the command.

*   _`cleanup-workdir`:_  The `cleanup-workdir` script has been removed because the script was found to be deleting files it should not have, which lead to broken build trees. Rather than trying to delete portions of [`TMPDIR`][1110] and getting it wrong, it is recommended that you delete `TMPDIR` and have it restored from shared state (sstate) on subsequent builds.

*   _`wipe-sysroot`:_  The `wipe-sysroot` script has been removed as it is no longer needed with recipe-specific sysroots.

### 6.11.4. Changes to Functions[¶][571]

The previously deprecated `bb.data.getVar()`, `bb.data.setVar()`, and related functions have been removed in favor of `d.getVar()`, `d.setVar()`, and so forth.

You need to fix any references to these old functions.

### 6.11.5. BitBake Changes[¶][572]

The following changes took place for BitBake:

*   _BitBake's Graphical Dependency Explorer UI Replaced:_  BitBake's graphical dependency explorer UI `depexp` was replaced by `taskexp` ("Task Explorer"), which provides a graphical way of exploring the `task-depends.dot` file. The data presented by Task Explorer is much more accurate than the data that was presented by `depexp`. Being able to visualize the data is an often requested feature as standard `*.dot` file viewers cannot usual cope with the size of the `task-depends.dot` file.

*   _BitBake "-g" Output Changes:_  The `package-depends.dot` and `pn-depends.dot` files as previously generated using the `bitbake -g` command have been removed. A `recipe-depends.dot` file is now generated as a collapsed version of `task-depends.dot` instead.

    The reason for this change is because `package-depends.dot` and `pn-depends.dot` largely date back to a time before task-based execution and do not take into account task-level dependencies between recipes, which could be misleading.

*   _Mirror Variable Splitting Changes:_  Mirror variables including [`MIRRORS`][1111], [`PREMIRRORS`][1112], and [`SSTATE_MIRRORS`][1113] can now separate values entirely with spaces. Consequently, you no longer need "\\n". BitBake looks for pairs of values, which simplifies usage. There should be no change required to existing mirror variable values themselves.

*   _The Subversion (SVN) Fetcher Uses an "ssh" Parameter and Not an "rsh" Parameter:_  The SVN fetcher now takes an "ssh" parameter instead of an "rsh" parameter. This new optional parameter is used when the "protocol" parameter is set to "svn+ssh". You can only use the new parameter to specify the `ssh` program used by SVN. The SVN fetcher passes the new parameter through the `SVN_SSH` environment variable during the [`do_fetch`][1114] task.

    See the "[Subversion (SVN) Fetcher (svn://)][1115]" section in the Yocto Project BitBake User Manual for additional information.

*   _`BB_SETSCENE_VERIFY_FUNCTION` and `BB_SETSCENE_VERIFY_FUNCTION2` Removed:_  Because the mechanism they were part of is no longer necessary with recipe-specific sysroots, the `BB_SETSCENE_VERIFY_FUNCTION` and `BB_SETSCENE_VERIFY_FUNCTION2` variables have been removed.

### 6.11.6. Absolute Symbolic Links[¶][573]

Absolute symbolic links (symlinks) within staged files are no longer permitted and now trigger an error. Any explicit creation of symlinks can use the`lnr` script, which is a replacement for `ln -r`.

If the build scripts in the software that the recipe is building are creating a number of absolute symlinks that need to be corrected, you can inherit`relative_symlinks` within the recipe to turn those absolute symlinks into relative symlinks.

### 6.11.7. GPLv2 Versions of GPLv3 Recipes Moved[¶][574]

Older GPLv2 versions of GPLv3 recipes have moved to a separate `meta-gplv2` layer.

If you use [`INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE`][3952] to exclude GPLv3 or set [`PREFERRED_VERSION`][3953] to substitute a GPLv2 version of a GPLv3 recipe, then you must add the `meta-gplv2` layer to your configuration.

### Note

You can find `meta-gplv2` layer in the OpenEmbedded layer index at[https://layers.openembedded.org/layerindex/branch/master/layer/meta-gplv2/][3954].

These relocated GPLv2 recipes do not receive the same level of maintenance as other core recipes. The recipes do not get security fixes and upstream no longer maintains them. In fact, the upstream community is actively hostile towards people that use the old versions of the recipes. Moving these recipes into a separate layer both makes the different needs of the recipes clearer and clearly identifies the number of these recipes.

### Note

The long-term solution might be to move to BSD-licensed replacements of the GPLv3 components for those that need to exclude GPLv3-licensed components from the target system. This solution will be investigated for future Yocto Project releases.

### 6.11.8. Package Management Changes[¶][575]

The following package management changes took place:

*   Smart package manager is replaced by DNF package manager. Smart has become unmaintained upstream, is not ported to Python 3.x. Consequently, Smart needed to be replaced. DNF is the only feasible candidate.

    The change in functionality is that the on-target runtime package management from remote package feeds is now done with a different tool that has a different set of command-line options. If you have scripts that call the tool directly, or use its API, they need to be fixed.

    For more information, see the [DNF Documentation][1116].

*   Rpm 5.x is replaced with Rpm 4.x. This is done for two major reasons:

    *   DNF is API-incompatible with Rpm 5.x and porting it and maintaining the port is non-trivial.

    *   Rpm 5.x itself has limited maintenance upstream, and the Yocto Project is one of the very few remaining users.

*   Berkeley DB 6.x is removed and Berkeley DB 5.x becomes the default:

    *   Version 6.x of Berkeley DB has largely been rejected by the open source community due to its AGPLv3 license. As a result, most mainstream open source projects that require DB are still developed and tested with DB 5.x.

    *   In OE-core, the only thing that was requiring DB 6.x was Rpm 5.x. Thus, no reason exists to continue carrying DB 6.x in OE-core.

*   `createrepo` is replaced with `createrepo_c`.

    `createrepo_c` is the current incarnation of the tool that generates remote repository metadata. It is written in C as compared to `createrepo`, which is written in Python. `createrepo_c` is faster and is maintained.

*   Architecture-independent RPM packages are "noarch" instead of "all".

    This change was made because too many places in DNF/RPM4 stack already make that assumption. Only the filenames and the architecture tag has changed. Nothing else has changed in OE-core system, particularly in the [`allarch.bbclass`][1117] class.

*   Signing of remote package feeds using `PACKAGE_FEED_SIGN` is not currently supported. This issue will be fully addressed in a future Yocto Project release. See [defect 11209][1118] for more information on a solution to package feed signing with RPM in the Yocto Project 2.3 release.

*   OPKG now uses the libsolv backend for resolving package dependencies by default. This is vastly superior to OPKG's internal ad-hoc solver that was previously used. This change does have a small impact on disk (around 500 KB) and memory footprint.

    ### Note

    For further details on this change, see the [commit message][1119].

### 6.11.9. Removed Recipes[¶][576]

The following recipes have been removed:

*   _`linux-yocto 4.8:`_  Version 4.8 has been removed. Versions 4.1 (LTSI), 4.4 (LTS), 4.9 (LTS/LTSI) and 4.10 are now present.

*   _`python-smartpm:`_  Functionally replaced by `dnf`.

*   _`createrepo:`_  Replaced by the `createrepo-c` recipe.

*   _`rpmresolve:`_  No longer needed with the move to RPM 4 as RPM itself is used instead.

*   _`gstreamer:`_  Removed the GStreamer Git version recipes as they have been stale. `1.10.` _`x`_  recipes are still present.

*   _`alsa-conf-base:`_  Merged into `alsa-conf` since `libasound` depended on both. Essentially, no way existed to install only one of these.

*   _`tremor:`_  Moved to `meta-multimedia`. Fixed-integer Vorbis decoding is not needed by current hardware. Thus, GStreamer's ivorbis plugin has been disabled by default eliminating the need for the `tremor` recipe in OE-Core.

*   _`gummiboot:`_  Replaced by `systemd-boot`.

### 6.11.10. Wic Changes[¶][577]

The following changes have been made to Wic:

### Note

For more information on Wic, see the "[Creating Partitioned Images][3955]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

*   _Default Output Directory Changed:_  Wic's default output directory is now the current directory by default instead of the unusual `/var/tmp/wic`.

    The "-o" and "--outdir" options remain unchanged and are used to specify your preferred output directory if you do not want to use the default directory.

*   _fsimage Plug-in Removed:_  The Wic fsimage plug-in has been removed as it duplicates functionality of the rawcopy plug-in.

### 6.11.11. QA Changes[¶][578]

The following QA checks have changed:

*   _`unsafe-references-in-binaries`:_  The `unsafe-references-in-binaries` QA check, which was disabled by default, has now been removed. This check was intended to detect binaries in `/bin` that link to libraries in `/usr/lib` and have the case where the user has `/usr` on a separate filesystem to `/`.

    The removed QA check was buggy. Additionally, `/usr` residing on a separate partition from `/` is now a rare configuration. Consequently, `unsafe-references-in-binaries` was removed.

*   _`file-rdeps`:_  The `file-rdeps` QA check is now an error by default instead of a warning. Because it is an error instead of a warning, you need to address missing runtime dependencies.

    For additional information, see the [`insane`][1120] class and the "[Errors and Warnings][1121]" section.

### 6.11.12. Miscellaneous Changes[¶][579]

The following miscellaneous changes have occurred:

*   In this release, a number of recipes have been changed to ignore the `largefile` [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][1122] item, enabling large file support unconditionally. This feature has always been enabled by default. Disabling the feature has not been widely tested.

    ### Note

    Future releases of the Yocto Project will remove entirely the ability to disable the `largefile` feature, which would make it unconditionally enabled everywhere.

*   If the [`DISTRO_VERSION`][1123] value contains the value of the [`DATE`][1124] variable, which is the default between Poky releases, the `DATE` value is explicitly excluded from `/etc/issue` and `/etc/issue.net`, which is displayed at the login prompt, in order to avoid conflicts with Multilib enabled. Regardless, the `DATE` value is inaccurate if the `base-files` recipe is restored from shared state (sstate) rather than rebuilt.

    If you need the build date recorded in `/etc/issue*` or anywhere else in your image, a better method is to define a post-processing function to do it and have the function called from [`ROOTFS_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND`][1125]. Doing so ensures the value is always up-to-date with the created image.

*   Dropbear's `init` script now disables DSA host keys by default. This change is in line with the systemd service file, which supports RSA keys only, and with recent versions of OpenSSH, which deprecates DSA host keys.

*   The [`buildhistory`][1126] class now correctly uses tabs as separators between all columns in `installed-package-sizes.txt` in order to aid import into other tools.

*   The `USE_LDCONFIG` variable has been replaced with the "ldconfig" [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][1127] feature. Distributions that previously set:

    ```
         USE_LDCONFIG = "0"

    ```

    should now instead use the following:

    ```
         DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED_append = " ldconfig"

    ```

*   The default value of [`COPYLEFT_LICENSE_INCLUDE`][1128] now includes all versions of AGPL licenses in addition to GPL and LGPL.

    ### Note

    The default list is not intended to be guaranteed as a complete safe list. You should seek legal advice based on what you are distributing if you are unsure.

*   Kernel module packages are now suffixed with the kernel version in order to allow module packages from multiple kernel versions to co-exist on a target system. If you wish to return to the previous naming scheme that does not include the version suffix, use the following:

    ```
         KERNEL_MODULE_PACKAGE_SUFFIX to ""

    ```

*   Removal of `libtool` `*.la` files is now enabled by default. The `*.la` files are not actually needed on Linux and relocating them is an unnecessary burden.

    If you need to preserve these `.la` files (e.g. in a custom distribution), you must change [`INHERIT_DISTRO`][1129] such that "remove-libtool" is not included in the value.

*   Extensible SDKs built for GCC 5+ now refuse to install on a distribution where the host GCC version is 4.8 or 4.9\. This change resulted from the fact that the installation is known to fail due to the way the `uninative` shared state (sstate) package is built. See the [`uninative`][1130] class for additional information.

*   All native and nativesdk recipes now use a separate [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][1131] value instead of sharing the value used by recipes for the target, in order to avoid unnecessary rebuilds.

    The `DISTRO_FEATURES` for `native` recipes is [`DISTRO_FEATURES_NATIVE`][1132] added to an intersection of `DISTRO_FEATURES` and[`DISTRO_FEATURES_FILTER_NATIVE`][1133].

    For nativesdk recipes, the corresponding variables are [`DISTRO_FEATURES_NATIVESDK`][1134] and [`DISTRO_FEATURES_FILTER_NATIVESDK`][1135].

*   The `FILESDIR` variable, which was previously deprecated and rarely used, has now been removed. You should change any recipes that set `FILESDIR`to set [`FILESPATH`][1136] instead.

*   The `MULTIMACH_HOST_SYS` variable has been removed as it is no longer needed with recipe-specific sysroots.

### Chapter 7. Source Directory Structure[¶][1886]

The [Source Directory][4526] consists of several components. Understanding them and knowing where they are located is key to using the Yocto Project well. This chapter describes the Source Directory and gives information about the various files and directories.

For information on how to establish a local Source Directory on your development system, see the "[Getting Set Up][4527]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

### Note

The OpenEmbedded build system does not support file or directory names that contain spaces. Be sure that the Source Directory you use does not contain these types of names.

### 7.1. Top-Level Core Components[¶][1194]

This section describes the top-level components of the [Source Directory][4236].

### 7.1.1. `bitbake/`[¶][580]

This directory includes a copy of BitBake for ease of use. The copy usually matches the current stable BitBake release from the BitBake project. BitBake, a [Metadata][3956] interpreter, reads the Yocto Project Metadata and runs the tasks defined by that data. Failures are usually from the Metadata and not from BitBake itself. Consequently, most users do not need to worry about BitBake.

When you run the `bitbake` command, the main BitBake executable, which resides in the `bitbake/bin/` directory, starts. Sourcing an environment setup script (e.g. [`oe-init-build-env`][3957] or [`oe-init-build-env-memres`][3958]) places the `scripts` and `bitbake/bin` directories (in that order) into the shell's `PATH` environment variable.

For more information on BitBake, see the [BitBake User Manual][3959].

### 7.1.2. `build/`[¶][581]

This directory contains user configuration files and the output generated by the OpenEmbedded build system in its standard configuration where the source tree is combined with the output. The [Build Directory][3960] is created initially when you `source` the OpenEmbedded build environment setup script (i.e. [`oe-init-build-env`][3961] or [`oe-init-build-env-memres`][3962]).

It is also possible to place output and configuration files in a directory separate from the [Source Directory][3963] by providing a directory name when you `source` the setup script. For information on separating output from your local Source Directory files, see the "[`oe-init-build-env`][3964] and "[`oe-init-build-env-memres`][3965]" sections.

### 7.1.3. `documentation/`[¶][582]

This directory holds the source for the Yocto Project documentation as well as templates and tools that allow you to generate PDF and HTML versions of the manuals. Each manual is contained in a sub-folder. For example, the files for this manual reside in the `ref-manual/` directory.

### 7.1.4. `meta/`[¶][583]

This directory contains the OpenEmbedded Core metadata. The directory holds recipes, common classes, and machine configuration for emulated targets (`qemux86`, `qemuarm`, and so forth.)

### 7.1.5. `meta-poky/`[¶][584]

This directory contains the configuration for the Poky reference distribution.

### 7.1.6. `meta-yocto-bsp/`[¶][585]

This directory contains the Yocto Project reference hardware Board Support Packages (BSPs). For more information on BSPs, see the [Yocto Project Board Support Package (BSP) Developer's Guide][3966].

### 7.1.7. `meta-selftest/`[¶][586]

This directory adds additional recipes and append files used by the OpenEmbedded selftests to verify the behavior of the build system.

You do not have to add this layer to your `bblayers.conf` file unless you want to run the selftests.

### 7.1.8. `meta-skeleton/`[¶][587]

This directory contains template recipes for BSP and kernel development.

### 7.1.9. `scripts/`[¶][588]

This directory contains various integration scripts that implement extra functionality in the Yocto Project environment (e.g. QEMU scripts). The [`oe-init-build-env`][3967] and [`oe-init-build-env-memres`][3968] scripts append this directory to the shell's `PATH` environment variable.

The `scripts` directory has useful scripts that assist in contributing back to the Yocto Project, such as `create-pull-request` and `send-pull-request`.

### 7.1.10. `oe-init-build-env`[¶][589]

This script is one of two scripts that set up the OpenEmbedded build environment. For information on the other script, see the "[`oe-init-build-env-memres`][3969]" section.

Running this script with the `source` command in a shell makes changes to `PATH` and sets other core BitBake variables based on the current working directory. You need to run an environment setup script before running BitBake commands. The script uses other scripts within the `scripts` directory to do the bulk of the work.

When you run this script, your Yocto Project environment is set up, a [Build Directory][3970] is created, your working directory becomes the Build Directory, and you are presented with a list of common BitBake targets. Here is an example:

```
     $ source oe-init-build-env

     ### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

     You can now run 'bitbake <target>'

     Common targets are:
         core-image-minimal
         core-image-sato
         meta-toolchain
         meta-ide-support

     You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'

```

The script gets its default list of common targets from the `conf-notes.txt` file, which is found in the `meta-poky` directory within the [Source Directory][3971]. Should you have custom distributions, it is very easy to modify this configuration file to include your targets for your distribution. See the "[Creating a Custom Template Configuration Directory][3972]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual for more information.

By default, running this script without a [Build Directory][3973] argument creates the `build` directory in your current working directory. If you provide a Build Directory argument when you `source` the script, you direct the OpenEmbedded build system to create a Build Directory of your choice. For example, the following command creates a Build Directory named `mybuilds` that is outside of the [Source Directory][3974]:

```
     $ source oe-init-build-env ~/mybuilds

```

The OpenEmbedded build system uses the template configuration files, which are found by default in the `meta-poky/conf` directory in the [Source Directory][3975]. See the "[Creating a Custom Template Configuration Directory][3976]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual for more information.

### Note

The OpenEmbedded build system does not support file or directory names that contain spaces. If you attempt to run the `oe-init-build-env` script from a Source Directory that contains spaces in either the filenames or directory names, the script returns an error indicating no such file or directory. Be sure to use a Source Directory free of names containing spaces.

### 7.1.11. `oe-init-build-env-memres`[¶][590]

This script is one of two scripts that set up the OpenEmbedded build environment. Aside from setting up the environment, this script starts a memory-resident BitBake server. For information on the other setup script, see the "[`oe-init-build-env`][3977]" section.

Memory-resident BitBake resides in memory until you specifically remove it using the following BitBake command:

```
     $ bitbake -m

```

Running this script with the `source` command in a shell makes changes to `PATH` and sets other core BitBake variables based on the current working directory. One of these variables is the [`BBSERVER`][3978] variable, which allows the OpenEmbedded build system to locate the server that is running BitBake.

You need to run an environment setup script before using BitBake commands. Following is the script syntax:

```
     $ source oe-init-build-env-memres port_number build_dir

```

Following are some considerations when sourcing this script:

*   The script uses other scripts within the `scripts` directory to do the bulk of the work.

*   If you do not provide a port number with the script, the BitBake server starts at a randomly selected port.

*   The script's parameters are positionally dependent. Consequently, you cannot run the script and provide a [Build Directory][1195] name without also providing a port number. In other words, the following syntax is illegal:

    ```
         $ source oe-initbuild-env-memres build_dir

    ```

    ### Note

    The previous restriction might be resolved in the future. See [Bug 7555][1196] for more information.

When you run this script, your Yocto Project environment is set up, a Build Directory is created, your working directory becomes the Build Directory, and you are presented with a list of common BitBake targets. Here is an example:

```
     $ source oe-init-build-env-memres
     No port specified, using dynamically selected port

     ### Shell environment set up for builds. ###

     You can now run 'bitbake <target>'

     Common targets are:
         core-image-minimal
         core-image-sato
         meta-toolchain
         meta-ide-support

     You can also run generated qemu images with a command like 'runqemu qemux86'
     Bitbake server address: 127.0.0.1, server port: 53995
     Bitbake server started on demand as needed, use bitbake -m to shut it down

```

The script gets its default list of common targets from the `conf-notes.txt` file, which is found in the `meta-poky` directory within the [Source Directory][3979]. Should you have custom distributions, it is very easy to modify this configuration file to include your targets for your distribution. See the "[Creating a Custom Template Configuration Directory][3980]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual for more information.

By default, running this script without a [Build Directory][3981] argument creates a build directory named `build`. If you provide a Build Directory argument and port number when you `source` the script, the Build Directory is created using that name. For example, the following command starts the BitBake server using port 53995 and creates a Build Directory named `mybuilds` that is outside of the [Source Directory][3982]:

```
     $ source oe-init-build-env-memres 53995 ~/mybuilds

```

The `oe-init-build-env-memres` script starts a memory resident BitBake server. This BitBake instance uses the `bitbake-cookerdaemon.log` file, which is located in the Build Directory.

The OpenEmbedded build system uses the template configuration files, which are found by default in the `meta-poky/conf` directory in the [Source Directory][3983]. See the "[Creating a Custom Template Configuration Directory][3984]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual for more information.

### Note

The OpenEmbedded build system does not support file or directory names that contain spaces. If you attempt to run the `oe-init-build-env-memres` script from a Source Directory that contains spaces in either the filenames or directory names, the script returns an error indicating no such file or directory. Be sure to use a Source Directory free of names containing spaces.

### 7.1.12. `LICENSE, README, and README.hardware`[¶][591]

These files are standard top-level files.

### 7.2. The Build Directory - `build/`[¶][1197]

The OpenEmbedded build system creates the [Build Directory][4237] when you run one of the build environment setup scripts (i.e. [`oe-init-build-env`][4238] or [`oe-init-build-env-memres`][4239]).

If you do not give the Build Directory a specific name when you run a setup script, the name defaults to `build`.

The [`TOPDIR`][4240] variable points to the Build Directory.

### 7.2.1. `build/buildhistory`[¶][592]

The OpenEmbedded build system creates this directory when you enable the build history feature. The directory tracks build information into image, packages, and SDK subdirectories. For information on the build history feature, see the "[Maintaining Build Output Quality][3985]" section.

### 7.2.2. `build/conf/local.conf`[¶][593]

This configuration file contains all the local user configurations for your build environment. The `local.conf` file contains documentation on the various configuration options. Any variable set here overrides any variable set elsewhere within the environment unless that variable is hard-coded within a file (e.g. by using '=' instead of '?='). Some variables are hard-coded for various reasons but these variables are relatively rare.

Edit this file to set the `[MACHINE][3525]` for which you want to build, which package types you wish to use ([`PACKAGE_CLASSES`][3986]), and the location from which you want to access downloaded files (`[DL_DIR][3526]`).

If `local.conf` is not present when you start the build, the OpenEmbedded build system creates it from `local.conf.sample` when you `source` the top-level build environment setup script (i.e. [`oe-init-build-env`][3987] or [`oe-init-build-env-memres`][3988]).

The source `local.conf.sample` file used depends on the `$TEMPLATECONF` script variable, which defaults to `meta-poky/conf` when you are building from the Yocto Project development environment and defaults to `meta/conf` when you are building from the OpenEmbedded Core environment. Because the script variable points to the source of the `local.conf.sample` file, this implies that you can configure your build environment from any layer by setting the variable in the top-level build environment setup script as follows:

```
     TEMPLATECONF=your_layer/conf

```

Once the build process gets the sample file, it uses `sed` to substitute final `${`[`OEROOT`][3989]`}` values for all `##OEROOT##` values.

### Note

You can see how the `TEMPLATECONF` variable is used by looking at the `scripts/oe-setup-builddir` script in the [Source Directory][3990]. You can find the Yocto Project version of the `local.conf.sample` file in the `meta-poky/conf` directory.

### 7.2.3. `build/conf/bblayers.conf`[¶][594]

This configuration file defines [layers][3991], which are directory trees, traversed (or walked) by BitBake. The `bblayers.conf` file uses the [`BBLAYERS`][3992] variable to list the layers BitBake tries to find.

If `bblayers.conf` is not present when you start the build, the OpenEmbedded build system creates it from `bblayers.conf.sample` when you `source`the top-level build environment setup script (i.e. [`oe-init-build-env`][3993] or [`oe-init-build-env-memres`][3994]).

The source `bblayers.conf.sample` file used depends on the `$TEMPLATECONF` script variable, which defaults to `meta-poky/conf` when you are building from the Yocto Project development environment and defaults to `meta/conf` when you are building from the OpenEmbedded Core environment. Because the script variable points to the source of the `bblayers.conf.sample` file, this implies that you can base your build from any layer by setting the variable in the top-level build environment setup script as follows:

```
     TEMPLATECONF=your_layer/conf

```

Once the build process gets the sample file, it uses `sed` to substitute final `${`[`OEROOT`][3995]`}` values for all `##OEROOT##` values.

### Note

You can see how the `TEMPLATECONF` variable `scripts/oe-setup-builddir` script in the [Source Directory][3996]. You can find the Yocto Project version of the `bblayers.conf.sample` file in the `meta-poky/conf` directory.

### 7.2.4. `build/conf/sanity_info`[¶][595]

This file indicates the state of the sanity checks and is created during the build.

### 7.2.5. `build/downloads/`[¶][596]

This directory contains downloaded upstream source tarballs. You can reuse the directory for multiple builds or move the directory to another location. You can control the location of this directory through the `[DL_DIR][3527]` variable.

### 7.2.6. `build/sstate-cache/`[¶][597]

This directory contains the shared state cache. You can reuse the directory for multiple builds or move the directory to another location. You can control the location of this directory through the `[SSTATE_DIR][3528]` variable.

### 7.2.7. `build/tmp/`[¶][598]

The OpenEmbedded build system creates and uses this directory for all the build system's output. The [`TMPDIR`][3997] variable points to this directory.

BitBake creates this directory if it does not exist. As a last resort, to clean up a build and start it from scratch (other than the downloads), you can remove everything in the `tmp` directory or get rid of the directory completely. If you do, you should also completely remove the `build/sstate-cache`directory.

### 7.2.8. `build/tmp/buildstats/`[¶][599]

This directory stores the build statistics.

### 7.2.9. `build/tmp/cache/`[¶][600]

When BitBake parses the metadata (recipes and configuration files), it caches the results in `build/tmp/cache/` to speed up future builds. The results are stored on a per-machine basis.

During subsequent builds, BitBake checks each recipe (together with, for example, any files included or appended to it) to see if they have been modified. Changes can be detected, for example, through file modification time (mtime) changes and hashing of file contents. If no changes to the file are detected, then the parsed result stored in the cache is reused. If the file has changed, it is reparsed.

### 7.2.10. `build/tmp/deploy/`[¶][601]

This directory contains any "end result" output from the OpenEmbedded build process. The [`DEPLOY_DIR`][3998] variable points to this directory. For more detail on the contents of the `deploy` directory, see the "[Images][3999]" and "[Application Development SDK][4000]" sections.

### 7.2.11. `build/tmp/deploy/deb/`[¶][602]

This directory receives any `.deb` packages produced by the build process. The packages are sorted into feeds for different architecture types.

### 7.2.12. `build/tmp/deploy/rpm/`[¶][603]

This directory receives any `.rpm` packages produced by the build process. The packages are sorted into feeds for different architecture types.

### 7.2.13. `build/tmp/deploy/ipk/`[¶][604]

This directory receives `.ipk` packages produced by the build process.

### 7.2.14. `build/tmp/deploy/licenses/`[¶][605]

This directory receives package licensing information. For example, the directory contains sub-directories for `bash`, `busybox`, and `glibc` (among others) that in turn contain appropriate `COPYING` license files with other licensing information. For information on licensing, see the "[Maintaining Open Source License Compliance During Your Product's Lifecycle][4001]" section.

### 7.2.15. `build/tmp/deploy/images/`[¶][606]

This directory receives complete filesystem images. If you want to flash the resulting image from a build onto a device, look here for the image.

Be careful when deleting files in this directory. You can safely delete old images from this directory (e.g. `core-image-*`). However, the kernel (`*zImage*`, `*uImage*`, etc.), bootloader and other supplementary files might be deployed here prior to building an image. Because these files are not directly produced from the image, if you delete them they will not be automatically re-created when you build the image again.

If you do accidentally delete files here, you will need to force them to be re-created. In order to do that, you will need to know the target that produced them. For example, these commands rebuild and re-create the kernel files:

```
     $ bitbake -c clean virtual/kernel
     $ bitbake virtual/kernel

```

### 7.2.16. `build/tmp/deploy/sdk/`[¶][607]

The OpenEmbedded build system creates this directory to hold toolchain installer scripts, which when executed, install the sysroot that matches your target hardware. You can find out more about these installers in the "[Building an SDK Installer][4002]" section in the Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK) Developer's Guide.

### 7.2.17. `build/tmp/sstate-control/`[¶][608]

The OpenEmbedded build system uses this directory for the shared state manifest files. The shared state code uses these files to record the files installed by each sstate task so that the files can be removed when cleaning the recipe or when a newer version is about to be installed. The build system also uses the manifests to detect and produce a warning when files from one task are overwriting those from another.

### 7.2.18. `build/tmp/sysroots/`[¶][609]

Previous versions of the OpenEmbedded build system used to create a global shared sysroot per machine along with a native sysroot. Beginning with the 2.3 version of the Yocto Project, sysroots exist in recipe-specific [`WORKDIR`][4003] directories. Thus, the `build/tmp/sysroots/` directory is unused.

### Note

The `build/tmp/sysroots/` directory can still be populated using the `bitbake build-sysroots` command and can be used for compatibility in some cases. However, in general it is not recommended to populate this directory. Individual recipe-specific sysroots should be used.

### 7.2.19. `build/tmp/stamps/`[¶][610]

This directory holds information that BitBake uses for accounting purposes to track what tasks have run and when they have run. The directory is sub-divided by architecture, package name, and version. Following is an example:

```
     stamps/all-poky-linux/distcc-config/1.0-r0.do_build-2fdd....2do

```

Although the files in the directory are empty of data, BitBake uses the filenames and timestamps for tracking purposes.

For information on how BitBake uses stamp files to determine if a task should be rerun, see the "[Stamp Files and the Rerunning of Tasks][4004]" section.

### 7.2.20. `build/tmp/log/`[¶][611]

This directory contains general logs that are not otherwise placed using the package's `[WORKDIR][3529]`. Examples of logs are the output from the`do_check_pkg` or `do_distro_check` tasks. Running a build does not necessarily mean this directory is created.

### 7.2.21. `build/tmp/work/`[¶][612]

This directory contains architecture-specific work sub-directories for packages built by BitBake. All tasks execute from the appropriate work directory. For example, the source for a particular package is unpacked, patched, configured and compiled all within its own work directory. Within the work directory, organization is based on the package group and version for which the source is being compiled as defined by the [`WORKDIR`][4005].

It is worth considering the structure of a typical work directory. As an example, consider `linux-yocto-kernel-3.0` on the machine `qemux86` built within the Yocto Project. For this package, a work directory of `tmp/work/qemux86-poky-linux/linux-yocto/3.0+git1+<.....>`, referred to as the `[WORKDIR][3530]`, is created. Within this directory, the source is unpacked to `linux-qemux86-standard-build` and then patched by Quilt. (See the "[Using Quilt in Your Workflow][4006]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual for more information.) Within the `linux-qemux86-standard-build` directory, standard Quilt directories `linux-3.0/patches` and `linux-3.0/.pc` are created, and standard Quilt commands can be used.

There are other directories generated within `WORKDIR`. The most important directory is `WORKDIR/temp/`, which has log files for each task (`log.do_*.pid`) and contains the scripts BitBake runs for each task (`run.do_*.pid`). The `WORKDIR/image/` directory is where "make install" places its output that is then split into sub-packages within `WORKDIR/packages-split/`.

### 7.2.22. `build/tmp/work/ _`tunearch`_ / _`recipename`_ / _`version`_ /`[¶][613]

The recipe work directory ( _`recipe_work_directory`_ ).

As described earlier in the "[`build/tmp/sysroots/`][4007]" section, beginning with the 2.3 release of the Yocto Project, the OpenEmbedded build system builds each recipe in its own work directory (i.e. [`WORKDIR`][4008]). The path to the work directory is constructed using the architecture of the given build (e.g.[`TUNE_PKGARCH`][4009], [`MACHINE_ARCH`][4010], or "allarch"), the recipe name, and the version of the recipe (i.e. [`PE`][4011]`:`[`PV`][4012]`-`[`PR`][4013]).

A number of key subdirectories exist within each recipe work directory:

*   `_`recipe_work_directory`_ /temp`: Contains the log files of each task executed for this recipe, the "run" files for each executed task, which contain the code run, and a `log.task_order` file, which lists the order in which tasks were executed.

*   `_`recipe_work_directory`_ /image`: Contains the output of the [`do_install`][1198] task, which corresponds to the `${`[`D`][1199]`}` variable in that task.

*   `_`recipe_work_directory`_ /pseudo`: Contains the pseudo database and log for any tasks executed under pseudo for the recipe.

*   `_`recipe_work_directory`_ /sysroot-destdir`: Contains the output of the [`do_populate_sysroot`][1200] task.

*   `_`recipe_work_directory`_ /package`: Contains the output of the [`do_package`][1201] task before the output is split into individual packages.

*   `_`recipe_work_directory`_ /packages-split`: Contains the output of the `do_package` task after the output has been split into individual packages. Subdirectories exist for each individual package created by the recipe.

*   `_`recipe_work_directory`_ /recipe-sysroot`: A directory populated with the target dependencies of the recipe. This directory looks like the target filesystem and contains libraries that the recipe might need to link against (e.g. the C library).

*   `_`recipe_work_directory`_ /recipe-sysroot-native`: A directory populated with the native dependencies of the recipe. This directory contains the tools the recipe needs to build (e.g. the compiler, Autoconf, libtool, and so forth).

*   `_`recipe_work_directory`_ /build`: This subdirectory applies only to recipes that support builds where the source is separate from the build artifacts. The OpenEmbedded build system uses this directory as a separate build directory (i.e. `${`[`B`][1202]`}`).

### 7.2.23. `build/tmp/work-shared/`[¶][614]

For efficiency, the OpenEmbedded build system creates and uses this directory to hold recipes that share a work directory with other recipes. In practice, this is only used for `gcc` and its variants (e.g. `gcc-cross`, `libgcc`, `gcc-runtime`, and so forth).

### 7.3. The Metadata - `meta/`[¶][1203]

As mentioned previously, [Metadata][4241] is the core of the Yocto Project. Metadata has several important subdivisions:

### 7.3.1. `meta/classes/`[¶][615]

This directory contains the `*.bbclass` files. Class files are used to abstract common code so it can be reused by multiple packages. Every package inherits the `base.bbclass` file. Examples of other important classes are `autotools.bbclass`, which in theory allows any Autotool-enabled package to work with the Yocto Project with minimal effort. Another example is `kernel.bbclass` that contains common code and functions for working with the Linux kernel. Functions like image generation or packaging also have their specific class files such as `image.bbclass`, `rootfs_*.bbclass` and`package*.bbclass`.

For reference information on classes, see the "[Classes][4014]" chapter.

### 7.3.2. `meta/conf/`[¶][616]

This directory contains the core set of configuration files that start from `bitbake.conf` and from which all other configuration files are included. See the include statements at the end of the `bitbake.conf` file and you will note that even `local.conf` is loaded from there. While `bitbake.conf` sets up the defaults, you can often override these by using the (`local.conf`) file, machine file or the distribution configuration file.

### 7.3.3. `meta/conf/machine/`[¶][617]

This directory contains all the machine configuration files. If you set `MACHINE = "qemux86"`, the OpenEmbedded build system looks for a `qemux86.conf`file in this directory. The `include` directory contains various data common to multiple machines. If you want to add support for a new machine to the Yocto Project, look in this directory.

### 7.3.4. `meta/conf/distro/`[¶][618]

The contents of this directory controls any distribution-specific configurations. For the Yocto Project, the `defaultsetup.conf` is the main file here. This directory includes the versions and the `SRCDATE` definitions for applications that are configured here. An example of an alternative configuration might be `poky-bleeding.conf`. Although this file mainly inherits its configuration from Poky.

### 7.3.5. `meta/conf/machine-sdk/`[¶][619]

The OpenEmbedded build system searches this directory for configuration files that correspond to the value of [`SDKMACHINE`][4015]. By default, 32-bit and 64-bit x86 files ship with the Yocto Project that support some SDK hosts. However, it is possible to extend that support to other SDK hosts by adding additional configuration files in this subdirectory within another layer.

### 7.3.6. `meta/files/`[¶][620]

This directory contains common license files and several text files used by the build system. The text files contain minimal device information and lists of files and directories with known permissions.

### 7.3.7. `meta/lib/`[¶][621]

This directory contains OpenEmbedded Python library code used during the build process.

### 7.3.8. `meta/recipes-bsp/`[¶][622]

This directory contains anything linking to specific hardware or hardware configuration information such as "u-boot" and "grub".

### 7.3.9. `meta/recipes-connectivity/`[¶][623]

This directory contains libraries and applications related to communication with other devices.

### 7.3.10. `meta/recipes-core/`[¶][624]

This directory contains what is needed to build a basic working Linux image including commonly used dependencies.

### 7.3.11. `meta/recipes-devtools/`[¶][625]

This directory contains tools that are primarily used by the build system. The tools, however, can also be used on targets.

### 7.3.12. `meta/recipes-extended/`[¶][626]

This directory contains non-essential applications that add features compared to the alternatives in core. You might need this directory for full tool functionality or for Linux Standard Base (LSB) compliance.

### 7.3.13. `meta/recipes-gnome/`[¶][627]

This directory contains all things related to the GTK+ application framework.

### 7.3.14. `meta/recipes-graphics/`[¶][628]

This directory contains X and other graphically related system libraries

### 7.3.15. `meta/recipes-kernel/`[¶][629]

This directory contains the kernel and generic applications and libraries that have strong kernel dependencies.

### 7.3.16. `meta/recipes-lsb4/`[¶][630]

This directory contains recipes specifically added to support the Linux Standard Base (LSB) version 4.x.

### 7.3.17. `meta/recipes-multimedia/`[¶][631]

This directory contains codecs and support utilities for audio, images and video.

### 7.3.18. `meta/recipes-rt/`[¶][632]

This directory contains package and image recipes for using and testing the `PREEMPT_RT` kernel.

### 7.3.19. `meta/recipes-sato/`[¶][633]

This directory contains the Sato demo/reference UI/UX and its associated applications and configuration data.

### 7.3.20. `meta/recipes-support/`[¶][634]

This directory contains recipes used by other recipes, but that are not directly included in images (i.e. dependencies of other recipes).

### 7.3.21. `meta/site/`[¶][635]

This directory contains a list of cached results for various architectures. Because certain "autoconf" test results cannot be determined when cross-compiling due to the tests not able to run on a live system, the information in this directory is passed to "autoconf" for the various architectures.

### 7.3.22. `meta/recipes.txt`[¶][636]

This file is a description of the contents of `recipes-*`.

### Chapter 8. Classes[¶][1887]

Class files are used to abstract common functionality and share it amongst multiple recipe (`.bb`) files. To use a class file, you simply make sure the recipe inherits the class. In most cases, when a recipe inherits a class it is enough to enable its features. There are cases, however, where in the recipe you might need to set variables or override some default behavior.

Any [Metadata][4528] usually found in a recipe can also be placed in a class file. Class files are identified by the extension `.bbclass` and are usually placed in a `classes/` directory beneath the `meta*/` directory found in the [Source Directory][4529]. Class files can also be pointed to by [`BUILDDIR`][4530] (e.g. `build/`) in the same way as `.conf` files in the `conf` directory. Class files are searched for in [`BBPATH`][4531] using the same method by which `.conf` files are searched.

This chapter discusses only the most useful and important classes. Other classes do exist within the `meta/classes` directory in the [Source Directory][4532]. You can reference the `.bbclass` files directly for more information.

### 8.1. `allarch.bbclass`[¶][1204]

The `allarch` class is inherited by recipes that do not produce architecture-specific output. The class disables functionality that is normally needed for recipes that produce executable binaries (such as building the cross-compiler and a C library as pre-requisites, and splitting out of debug symbols during packaging).

### Note

Unlike some distro recipes (e.g. Debian), OpenEmbedded recipes that produce packages that depend on tunings through use of the[`RDEPENDS`][4016] and [`TUNE_PKGARCH`][4017] variables, should never be configured for all architectures using `allarch`. This is the case even if the recipes do not produce architecture-specific output.

Configuring such recipes for all architectures causes the [`do_package_write_*`][4018] tasks to have different signatures for the machines with different tunings. Additionally, unnecessary rebuilds occur every time an image for a different `MACHINE` is built even when the recipe never changes.

By default, all recipes inherit the [`base`][4242] and [`package`][4243] classes, which enable functionality needed for recipes that produce executable output. If your recipe, for example, only produces packages that contain configuration files, media files, or scripts (e.g. Python and Perl), then it should inherit the `allarch` class.

### 8.2. `archiver.bbclass`[¶][1205]

The `archiver` class supports releasing source code and other materials with the binaries.

For more details on the source archiver, see the "[Maintaining Open Source License Compliance During Your Product's Lifecycle][4244]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual. You can also see the [`ARCHIVER_MODE`][4245] variable for information about the variable flags (varflags) that help control archive creation.

### 8.3. `autotools*.bbclass`[¶][1206]

The `autotools*` classes support Autotooled packages.

The `autoconf`, `automake`, and `libtool` packages bring standardization. This class defines a set of tasks (e.g. `configure`, `compile` and so forth) that work for all Autotooled packages. It should usually be enough to define a few standard variables and then simply `inherit autotools`. These classes can also work with software that emulates Autotools. For more information, see the "[Autotooled Package][4246]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

By default, the `autotools*` classes use out-of-tree builds (i.e. `autotools.bbclass`). ([`B`][4247] `!=` [`S`][4248]).

If the software being built by a recipe does not support using out-of-tree builds, you should have the recipe inherit the `autotools-brokensep` class. The `autotools-brokensep` class behaves the same as the `autotools` class but builds with [`B`][4249] == [`S`][4250]. This method is useful when out-of-tree build support is either not present or is broken.

### Note

It is recommended that out-of-tree support be fixed and used if at all possible.

It's useful to have some idea of how the tasks defined by the `autotools*` classes work and what they do behind the scenes.

*   [`do_configure`][1888] - Regenerates the configure script (using `autoreconf`) and then launches it with a standard set of arguments used during cross-compilation. You can pass additional parameters to `configure` through the `[EXTRA_OECONF][1207]` or [`PACKAGECONFIG_CONFARGS`][1889] variables.

*   [`do_compile`][1890] - Runs `make` with arguments that specify the compiler and linker. You can pass additional arguments through the `[EXTRA_OEMAKE][1208]`variable.

*   [`do_install`][1891] - Runs `make install` and passes in `${`[`D`][1892]`}` as `DESTDIR`.

### 8.4. `base.bbclass`[¶][1209]

The `base` class is special in that every `.bb` file implicitly inherits the class. This class contains definitions for standard basic tasks such as fetching, unpacking, configuring (empty by default), compiling (runs any `Makefile` present), installing (empty by default) and packaging (empty by default). These classes are often overridden or extended by other classes such as the [`autotools`][4251] class or the [`package`][4252] class.

The class also contains some commonly used functions such as `oe_runmake`, which runs `make` with the arguments specified in [`EXTRA_OEMAKE`][4253] variable as well as the arguments passed directly to `oe_runmake`.

### 8.5. `bash-completion.bbclass`[¶][1210]

Sets up packaging and dependencies appropriate for recipes that build software that includes bash-completion data.

### 8.6. `bin_package.bbclass`[¶][1211]

The `bin_package` class is a helper class for recipes that extract the contents of a binary package (e.g. an RPM) and install those contents rather than building the binary from source. The binary package is extracted and new packages in the configured output package format are created. Extraction and installation of proprietary binaries is a good example use for this class.

### Note

For RPMs and other packages that do not contain a subdirectory, you should specify an appropriate fetcher parameter to point to the subdirectory. For example, if BitBake is using the Git fetcher (`git://`), the "subpath" parameter limits the checkout to a specific subpath of the tree. Here is an example where `${BP}` is used so that the files are extracted into the subdirectory expected by the default value of [`S`][4254]:
```
     SRC_URI = "git://example.com/downloads/somepackage.rpm;subpath=${BP}"

```
See the "[Fetchers][4255]" section in the BitBake User Manual for more information on supported BitBake Fetchers.

### 8.7. `binconfig.bbclass`[¶][1212]

The `binconfig` class helps to correct paths in shell scripts.

Before `pkg-config` had become widespread, libraries shipped shell scripts to give information about the libraries and include paths needed to build software (usually named `LIBNAME-config`). This class assists any recipe using such scripts.

During staging, the OpenEmbedded build system installs such scripts into the `sysroots/` directory. Inheriting this class results in all paths in these scripts being changed to point into the `sysroots/` directory so that all builds that use the script use the correct directories for the cross compiling layout. See the [`BINCONFIG_GLOB`][4256] variable for more information.

### 8.8. `binconfig-disabled.bbclass`[¶][1213]

An alternative version of the [`binconfig`][4257] class, which disables binary configuration scripts by making them return an error in favor of using `pkg-config`to query the information. The scripts to be disabled should be specified using the [`BINCONFIG`][4258] variable within the recipe inheriting the class.

### 8.9. `blacklist.bbclass`[¶][1214]

The `blacklist` class prevents the OpenEmbedded build system from building specific recipes (blacklists them). To use this class, inherit the class globally and set [`PNBLACKLIST`][4259] for each recipe you wish to blacklist. Specify the [`PN`][4260] value as a variable flag (varflag) and provide a reason, which is reported, if the package is requested to be built as the value. For example, if you want to blacklist a recipe called "exoticware", you add the following to your `local.conf` or distribution configuration:

```
     INHERIT += "blacklist"
     PNBLACKLIST[exoticware] = "Not supported by our organization."

```

### 8.10. `bluetooth.bbclass`[¶][1215]

The `bluetooth` class defines a variable that expands to the recipe (package) providing core bluetooth support on the platform.

For details on how the class works, see the `meta/classes/bluetooth.bbclass` file in the Yocto Project [Source Directory][4261].

### 8.11. `bugzilla.bbclass`[¶][1216]

The `bugzilla` class supports setting up an instance of Bugzilla in which you can automatically files bug reports in response to build failures. For this class to work, you need to enable the XML-RPC interface in the instance of Bugzilla.

### 8.12. `buildhistory.bbclass`[¶][1217]

The `buildhistory` class records a history of build output metadata, which can be used to detect possible regressions as well as used for analysis of the build output. For more information on using Build History, see the "[Maintaining Build Output Quality][4262]" section.

### 8.13. `buildstats.bbclass`[¶][1218]

The `buildstats` class records performance statistics about each task executed during the build (e.g. elapsed time, CPU usage, and I/O usage).

When you use this class, the output goes into the [`BUILDSTATS_BASE`][4263] directory, which defaults to `${TMPDIR}/buildstats/`. You can analyze the elapsed time using `scripts/pybootchartgui/pybootchartgui.py`, which produces a cascading chart of the entire build process and can be useful for highlighting bottlenecks.

Collecting build statistics is enabled by default through the [`USER_CLASSES`][4264] variable from your `local.conf` file. Consequently, you do not have to do anything to enable the class. However, if you want to disable the class, simply remove "buildstats" from the `USER_CLASSES` list.

### 8.14. `buildstats-summary.bbclass`[¶][1219]

When inherited globally, prints statistics at the end of the build on sstate re-use. In order to function, this class requires the [`buildstats`][4265] class be enabled.

### 8.15. `ccache.bbclass`[¶][1220]

The `ccache` class enables the [C/C++ Compiler Cache][4266] for the build. This class is used to give a minor performance boost during the build. However, using the class can lead to unexpected side-effects. Thus, it is recommended that you do not use this class. See [http://ccache.samba.org/][4267] for information on the C/C++ Compiler Cache.

### 8.16. `chrpath.bbclass`[¶][1221]

The `chrpath` class is a wrapper around the "chrpath" utility, which is used during the build process for `nativesdk`, `cross`, and `cross-canadian` recipes to change `RPATH` records within binaries in order to make them relocatable.

### 8.17. `clutter.bbclass`[¶][1222]

The `clutter` class consolidates the major and minor version naming and other common items used by Clutter and related recipes.

### Note

Unlike some other classes related to specific libraries, recipes building other software that uses Clutter do not need to inherit this class unless they use the same recipe versioning scheme that the Clutter and related recipes do.

### 8.18. `cmake.bbclass`[¶][1223]

The `cmake` class allows for recipes that need to build software using the CMake build system. You can use the [`EXTRA_OECMAKE`][4268] variable to specify additional configuration options to be passed on the `cmake` command line.

### 8.19. `cml1.bbclass`[¶][1224]

The `cml1` class provides basic support for the Linux kernel style build configuration system.

### 8.20. `compress_doc.bbclass`[¶][1225]

Enables compression for man pages and info pages. This class is intended to be inherited globally. The default compression mechanism is gz (gzip) but you can select an alternative mechanism by setting the [`DOC_COMPRESS`][4269] variable.

### 8.21. `copyleft_compliance.bbclass`[¶][1226]

The `copyleft_compliance` class preserves source code for the purposes of license compliance. This class is an alternative to the `archiver` class and is still used by some users even though it has been deprecated in favor of the [`archiver`][4270] class.

### 8.22. `copyleft_filter.bbclass`[¶][1227]

A class used by the [`archiver`][4271] and [`copyleft_compliance`][4272] classes for filtering licenses. The `copyleft_filter` class is an internal class and is not intended to be used directly.

### 8.23. `core-image.bbclass`[¶][1228]

The `core-image` class provides common definitions for the `core-image-*` image recipes, such as support for additional [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][4273].

### 8.24. `cpan*.bbclass`[¶][1229]

The `cpan*` classes support Perl modules.

Recipes for Perl modules are simple. These recipes usually only need to point to the source's archive and then inherit the proper class file. Building is split into two methods depending on which method the module authors used.

*   Modules that use old `Makefile.PL`-based build system require `cpan.bbclass` in their recipes.

*   Modules that use `Build.PL`-based build system require using `cpan_build.bbclass` in their recipes.

Both build methods inherit the `cpan-base` class for basic Perl support.

### 8.25. `cross.bbclass`[¶][1230]

The `cross` class provides support for the recipes that build the cross-compilation tools.

### 8.26. `cross-canadian.bbclass`[¶][1231]

The `cross-canadian` class provides support for the recipes that build the Canadian Cross-compilation tools for SDKs. See the "[Cross-Development Toolchain Generation][4274]" section for more discussion on these cross-compilation tools.

### 8.27. `crosssdk.bbclass`[¶][1232]

The `crosssdk` class provides support for the recipes that build the cross-compilation tools used for building SDKs. See the "[Cross-Development Toolchain Generation][4275]" section for more discussion on these cross-compilation tools.

### 8.28. `debian.bbclass`[¶][1233]

The `debian` class renames output packages so that they follow the Debian naming policy (i.e. `glibc` becomes `libc6` and `glibc-devel` becomes `libc6-dev`.) Renaming includes the library name and version as part of the package name.

If a recipe creates packages for multiple libraries (shared object files of `.so` type), use the [`LEAD_SONAME`][4276] variable in the recipe to specify the library on which to apply the naming scheme.

### 8.29. `deploy.bbclass`[¶][1234]

The `deploy` class handles deploying files to the [`DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE`][4277] directory. The main function of this class is to allow the deploy step to be accelerated by shared state. Recipes that inherit this class should define their own [`do_deploy`][4278] function to copy the files to be deployed to [`DEPLOYDIR`][4279], and use `addtask` to add the task at the appropriate place, which is usually after [`do_compile`][4280] or [`do_install`][4281]. The class then takes care of staging the files from `DEPLOYDIR` to `DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE`.

### 8.30. `devshell.bbclass`[¶][1235]

The `devshell` class adds the `do_devshell` task. Distribution policy dictates whether to include this class. See the "[Using a Development Shell][4282]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual for more information about using `devshell`.

### 8.31. `distro_features_check.bbclass`[¶][1236]

The `distro_features_check` class allows individual recipes to check for required and conflicting [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][4283].

This class provides support for the [`REQUIRED_DISTRO_FEATURES`][4284] and [`CONFLICT_DISTRO_FEATURES`][4285] variables. If any conditions specified in the recipe using the above variables are not met, the recipe will be skipped.

### 8.32. `distrodata.bbclass`[¶][1237]

The `distrodata` class provides for automatic checking for upstream recipe updates. The class creates a comma-separated value (CSV) spreadsheet that contains information about the recipes. The information provides the [`do_distrodata`][4286] and `do_distro_check` tasks, which do upstream checking and also verify if a package is used in multiple major distributions.

The class is not included by default. To use it, you must set the [`INHERIT`][4287] variable:

```
     INHERIT+= "distrodata"

```

The `distrodata` class also provides the [`do_checkpkg`][4288] task, which can be used against a simple recipe or against an image to get all its recipe information.

### 8.33. `distutils*.bbclass`[¶][1238]

The `distutils*` classes support recipes for Python version 2.x extensions, which are simple. These recipes usually only need to point to the source's archive and then inherit the proper class. Building is split into two methods depending on which method the module authors used.

*   Extensions that use an Autotools-based build system require Autotools and the classes based on `distutils` in their recipes.

*   Extensions that use build systems based on `distutils` require the `distutils` class in their recipes.

*   Extensions that use build systems based on `setuptools` require the [`setuptools`][1893] class in their recipes.

The `distutils-common-base` class is required by some of the `distutils*` classes to provide common Python2 support.

The `distutils-tools` class supports recipes for additional "distutils" tools.

### 8.34. `distutils3*.bbclass`[¶][1239]

The `distutils3*` classes support recipes for Python version 3.x extensions, which are simple. These recipes usually only need to point to the source's archive and then inherit the proper class. Building is split into three methods depending on which method the module authors used.

*   Extensions that use an Autotools-based build system require Autotools and `distutils`-based classes in their recipes.

*   Extensions that use `distutils`-based build systems require the `distutils` class in their recipes.

*   Extensions that use build systems based on `setuptools3` require the [`setuptools3`][1894] class in their recipes.

The `distutils3*` classes either inherit their corresponding `distutils*` class or replicate them using a Python3 version instead (e.g. `distutils3-base`inherits `distutils-common-base`, which is the same as `distutils-base` but inherits `python3native` instead of `pythonnative`).

### 8.35. `externalsrc.bbclass`[¶][1240]

The `externalsrc` class supports building software from source code that is external to the OpenEmbedded build system. Building software from an external source tree means that the build system's normal fetch, unpack, and patch process is not used.

By default, the OpenEmbedded build system uses the [`S`][4289] and [`B`][4290] variables to locate unpacked recipe source code and to build it, respectively. When your recipe inherits the `externalsrc` class, you use the [`EXTERNALSRC`][4291] and [`EXTERNALSRC_BUILD`][4292] variables to ultimately define `S` and `B`.

By default, this class expects the source code to support recipe builds that use the [`B`][4293] variable to point to the directory in which the OpenEmbedded build system places the generated objects built from the recipes. By default, the `B` directory is set to the following, which is separate from the source directory (`S`):

```
     ${WORKDIR}/${BPN}/{PV}/

```

See these variables for more information: [`WORKDIR`][4294], [`BPN`][4295], and [`PV`][4296],

For more information on the `externalsrc` class, see the comments in `meta/classes/externalsrc.bbclass` in the [Source Directory][4297]. For information on how to use the `externalsrc` class, see the "[Building Software from an External Source][4298]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

### 8.36. `extrausers.bbclass`[¶][1241]

The `extrausers` class allows additional user and group configuration to be applied at the image level. Inheriting this class either globally or from an image recipe allows additional user and group operations to be performed using the [`EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS`][4299] variable.

### Note

The user and group operations added using the `extrausers` class are not tied to a specific recipe outside of the recipe for the image. Thus, the operations can be performed across the image as a whole. Use the [`useradd`][4300] class to add user and group configuration to a specific recipe.

Here is an example that uses this class in an image recipe:

```
     inherit extrausers
     EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "\
         useradd -p '' tester; \
         groupadd developers; \
         userdel nobody; \
         groupdel -g video; \
         groupmod -g 1020 developers; \
         usermod -s /bin/sh tester; \
         "

```

Here is an example that adds two users named "tester-jim" and "tester-sue" and assigns passwords:

```
     inherit extrausers
     EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "\
         useradd -P tester01 tester-jim; \
         useradd -P tester01 tester-sue; \
         "

```

Finally, here is an example that sets the root password to "1876*18":

```
     inherit extrausers
     EXTRA_USERS_PARAMS = "\
         usermod -P 1876*18 root; \
         "

```

### 8.37. `fontcache.bbclass`[¶][1242]

The `fontcache` class generates the proper post-install and post-remove (postinst and postrm) scriptlets for font packages. These scriptlets call `fc-cache` (part of `Fontconfig`) to add the fonts to the font information cache. Since the cache files are architecture-specific, `fc-cache` runs using QEMU if the postinst scriptlets need to be run on the build host during image creation.

If the fonts being installed are in packages other than the main package, set [`FONT_PACKAGES`][4301] to specify the packages containing the fonts.

### 8.38. `fs-uuid.bbclass`[¶][1243]

The `fs-uuid` class extracts UUID from `${`[`ROOTFS`][4302]`}`, which must have been built by the time that this function gets called. The `fs-uuid` class only works on `ext` file systems and depends on `tune2fs`.

### 8.39. `gconf.bbclass`[¶][1244]

The `gconf` class provides common functionality for recipes that need to install GConf schemas. The schemas will be put into a separate package (`${`[`PN`][4303]`}-gconf`) that is created automatically when this class is inherited. This package uses the appropriate post-install and post-remove (postinst/postrm) scriptlets to register and unregister the schemas in the target image.

### 8.40. `gettext.bbclass`[¶][1245]

The `gettext` class provides support for building software that uses the GNU `gettext` internationalization and localization system. All recipes building software that use `gettext` should inherit this class.

### 8.41. `gnome.bbclass`[¶][1246]

The `gnome` class supports recipes that build software from the GNOME stack. This class inherits the [`gnomebase`][4304], [`gtk-icon-cache`][4305], [`gconf`][4306] and [`mime`][4307]classes. The class also disables GObject introspection where applicable.

### 8.42. `gnomebase.bbclass`[¶][1247]

The `gnomebase` class is the base class for recipes that build software from the GNOME stack. This class sets [`SRC_URI`][4308] to download the source from the GNOME mirrors as well as extending [`FILES`][4309] with the typical GNOME installation paths.

### 8.43. `gobject-introspection.bbclass`[¶][1248]

Provides support for recipes building software that supports GObject introspection. This functionality is only enabled if the "gobject-introspection-data" feature is in [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][4310] as well as "qemu-usermode" being in [`MACHINE_FEATURES`][4311].

### Note

This functionality is backfilled by default and, if not applicable, should be disabled through [`DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED`][4312]or [`MACHINE_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED`][4313], respectively.

### 8.44. `grub-efi.bbclass`[¶][1249]

The `grub-efi` class provides `grub-efi`-specific functions for building bootable images.

This class supports several variables:

*   [`INITRD`][1895]: Indicates list of filesystem images to concatenate and use as an initial RAM disk (initrd) (optional).

*   [`ROOTFS`][1896]: Indicates a filesystem image to include as the root filesystem (optional).

*   [`GRUB_GFXSERIAL`][1897]: Set this to "1" to have graphics and serial in the boot menu.

*   [`LABELS`][1898]: A list of targets for the automatic configuration.

*   [`APPEND`][1899]: An override list of append strings for each `LABEL`.

*   [`GRUB_OPTS`][1900]: Additional options to add to the configuration (optional). Options are delimited using semi-colon characters (`;`).

*   [`GRUB_TIMEOUT`][1901]: Timeout before executing the default `LABEL` (optional).

### 8.45. `gsettings.bbclass`[¶][1250]

The `gsettings` class provides common functionality for recipes that need to install GSettings (glib) schemas. The schemas are assumed to be part of the main package. Appropriate post-install and post-remove (postinst/postrm) scriptlets are added to register and unregister the schemas in the target image.

### 8.46. `gtk-doc.bbclass`[¶][1251]

The `gtk-doc` class is a helper class to pull in the appropriate `gtk-doc` dependencies and disable `gtk-doc`.

### 8.47. `gtk-icon-cache.bbclass`[¶][1252]

The `gtk-icon-cache` class generates the proper post-install and post-remove (postinst/postrm) scriptlets for packages that use GTK+ and install icons. These scriptlets call `gtk-update-icon-cache` to add the fonts to GTK+'s icon cache. Since the cache files are architecture-specific, `gtk-update-icon-cache` is run using QEMU if the postinst scriptlets need to be run on the build host during image creation.

### 8.48. `gtk-immodules-cache.bbclass`[¶][1253]

The `gtk-immodules-cache` class generates the proper post-install and post-remove (postinst/postrm) scriptlets for packages that install GTK+ input method modules for virtual keyboards. These scriptlets call `gtk-update-icon-cache` to add the input method modules to the cache. Since the cache files are architecture-specific, `gtk-update-icon-cache` is run using QEMU if the postinst scriptlets need to be run on the build host during image creation.

If the input method modules being installed are in packages other than the main package, set [`GTKIMMODULES_PACKAGES`][4314] to specify the packages containing the modules.

### 8.49. `gzipnative.bbclass`[¶][1254]

The `gzipnative` class enables the use of different native versions of `gzip` and `pigz` rather than the versions of these tools from the build host.

### 8.50. `icecc.bbclass`[¶][1255]

The `icecc` class supports [Icecream][4315], which facilitates taking compile jobs and distributing them among remote machines.

The class stages directories with symlinks from `gcc` and `g++` to `icecc`, for both native and cross compilers. Depending on each configure or compile, the OpenEmbedded build system adds the directories at the head of the `PATH` list and then sets the `ICECC_CXX` and `ICEC_CC` variables, which are the paths to the `g++` and `gcc` compilers, respectively.

For the cross compiler, the class creates a `tar.gz` file that contains the Yocto Project toolchain and sets `ICECC_VERSION`, which is the version of the cross-compiler used in the cross-development toolchain, accordingly.

The class handles all three different compile stages (i.e native ,cross-kernel and target) and creates the necessary environment `tar.gz` file to be used by the remote machines. The class also supports SDK generation.

If [`ICECC_PATH`][4316] is not set in your `local.conf` file, then the class tries to locate the `icecc` binary using `which`. If [`ICECC_ENV_EXEC`][4317] is set in your `local.conf` file, the variable should point to the `icecc-create-env` script provided by the user. If you do not point to a user-provided script, the build system uses the default script provided by the recipe `icecc-create-env-native.bb`.

### Note

This script is a modified version and not the one that comes with `icecc`.

If you do not want the Icecream distributed compile support to apply to specific recipes or classes, you can effectively "blacklist" them by listing the recipes and classes using the [`ICECC_USER_PACKAGE_BL`][4318] and [`ICECC_USER_CLASS_BL`][4319], variables, respectively, in your `local.conf` file. Doing so causes the OpenEmbedded build system to handle these compilations locally.

Additionally, you can list recipes using the [`ICECC_USER_PACKAGE_WL`][4320] variable in your `local.conf` file to force `icecc` to be enabled for recipes using an empty [`PARALLEL_MAKE`][4321] variable.

Inheriting the `icecc` class changes all sstate signatures. Consequently, if a development team has a dedicated build system that populates[`STATE_MIRRORS`][4322] and they want to reuse sstate from `STATE_MIRRORS`, then all developers and the build system need to either inherit the `icecc` class or nobody should.

At the distribution level, you can inherit the `icecc` class to be sure that all builders start with the same sstate signatures. After inheriting the class, you can then disable the feature by setting the [`ICECC_DISABLED`][4323] variable to "1" as follows:

```
     INHERIT_DISTRO_append = " icecc"
     ICECC_DISABLED ??= "1"

```

This practice makes sure everyone is using the same signatures but also requires individuals that do want to use Icecream to enable the feature individually as follows in your `local.conf` file:

```
     ICECC_DISABLED = ""

```

### 8.51. `image.bbclass`[¶][1256]

The `image` class helps support creating images in different formats. First, the root filesystem is created from packages using one of the `rootfs*.bbclass` files (depending on the package format used) and then one or more image files are created.

*   The `[IMAGE_FSTYPES][1257]` variable controls the types of images to generate.

*   The `[IMAGE_INSTALL][1258]` variable controls the list of packages to install into the image.

For information on customizing images, see the "[Customizing Images][4324]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual. For information on how images are created, see the "[Images][4325]" section elsewhere in this manual.

### 8.52. `image-buildinfo.bbclass`[¶][1259]

The `image-buildinfo` class writes information to the target filesystem on `/etc/build`.

### 8.53. `image_types.bbclass`[¶][1260]

The `image_types` class defines all of the standard image output types that you can enable through the [`IMAGE_FSTYPES`][4326] variable. You can use this class as a reference on how to add support for custom image output types.

By default, this class is enabled through the [`IMAGE_CLASSES`][4327] variable in [`image.bbclass`][4328]. If you define your own image types using a custom BitBake class and then use `IMAGE_CLASSES` to enable it, the custom class must either inherit `image_types` or `image_types` must also appear in `IMAGE_CLASSES`.

### 8.54. `image_types_uboot.bbclass`[¶][1261]

The `image_types_uboot` class defines additional image types specifically for the U-Boot bootloader.

### 8.55. `image-live.bbclass`[¶][1262]

This class controls building "live" (i.e. HDDIMG and ISO) images. Live images contain syslinux for legacy booting, as well as the bootloader specified by[`EFI_PROVIDER`][4329] if [`MACHINE_FEATURES`][4330] contains "efi".

Normally, you do not use this class directly. Instead, you add "live" to [`IMAGE_FSTYPES`][4331]. You can selectively build just one of these types through the[`NOISO`][4332] and [`NOHDD`][4333] variables. For example, if you were building an ISO image, you would add "live" to `IMAGE_FSTYPES`, set the `NOISO` variable to "0" and the build system would use the `image-live` class to build the ISO image.

### 8.56. `image-mklibs.bbclass`[¶][1263]

The `image-mklibs` class enables the use of the `mklibs` utility during the [`do_rootfs`][4334] task, which optimizes the size of libraries contained in the image.

By default, the class is enabled in the `local.conf.template` using the [`USER_CLASSES`][4335] variable as follows:

```
     USER_CLASSES ?= "buildstats image-mklibs image-prelink"

```

### 8.57. `image-prelink.bbclass`[¶][1264]

The `image-prelink` class enables the use of the `prelink` utility during the [`do_rootfs`][4336] task, which optimizes the dynamic linking of shared libraries to reduce executable startup time.

By default, the class is enabled in the `local.conf.template` using the [`USER_CLASSES`][4337] variable as follows:

```
     USER_CLASSES ?= "buildstats image-mklibs image-prelink"

```

### 8.58. `image-vm.bbclass`[¶][1265]

The `image-vm` class supports building VM images.

### 8.59. `image-vmdk.bbclass`[¶][1266]

The `image-vmdk` class supports building VMware VMDK images. Normally, you do not use this class directly. Instead, you add "vmdk" to[`IMAGE_FSTYPES`][4338].

### 8.60. `insane.bbclass`[¶][1267]

The `insane` class adds a step to the package generation process so that output quality assurance checks are generated by the OpenEmbedded build system. A range of checks are performed that check the build's output for common problems that show up during runtime. Distribution policy usually dictates whether to include this class.

You can configure the sanity checks so that specific test failures either raise a warning or an error message. Typically, failures for new tests generate a warning. Subsequent failures for the same test would then generate an error message once the metadata is in a known and good condition. See the "[QA Error and Warning Messages][4339]" Chapter for a list of all the warning and error messages you might encounter using a default configuration.

Use the [`WARN_QA`][4340] and [`ERROR_QA`][4341] variables to control the behavior of these checks at the global level (i.e. in your custom distro configuration). However, to skip one or more checks in recipes, you should use [`INSANE_SKIP`][4342]. For example, to skip the check for symbolic link `.so` files in the main package of a recipe, add the following to the recipe. You need to realize that the package name override, in this example `${PN}`, must be used:

```
     INSANE_SKIP_${PN} += "dev-so"

```

Please keep in mind that the QA checks exist in order to detect real or potential problems in the packaged output. So exercise caution when disabling these checks.

The following list shows the tests you can list with the `WARN_QA` and `ERROR_QA` variables:

*   _`already-stripped:`_  Checks that produced binaries have not already been stripped prior to the build system extracting debug symbols. It is common for upstream software projects to default to stripping debug symbols for output binaries. In order for debugging to work on the target using`-dbg` packages, this stripping must be disabled.

*   _`arch:`_  Checks the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) type, bit size, and endianness of any binaries to ensure they match the target architecture. This test fails if any binaries do not match the type since there would be an incompatibility. The test could indicate that the wrong compiler or compiler options have been used. Sometimes software, like bootloaders, might need to bypass this check.

*   _`buildpaths:`_  Checks for paths to locations on the build host inside the output files. Currently, this test triggers too many false positives and thus is not normally enabled.

*   _`build-deps:`_  Determines if a build-time dependency that is specified through [`DEPENDS`][1902], explicit [`RDEPENDS`][1903], or task-level dependencies exists to match any runtime dependency. This determination is particularly useful to discover where runtime dependencies are detected and added during packaging. If no explicit dependency has been specified within the metadata, at the packaging stage it is too late to ensure that the dependency is built, and thus you can end up with an error when the package is installed into the image during the [`do_rootfs`][1904] task because the auto-detected dependency was not satisfied. An example of this would be where the [`update-rc.d`][1905] class automatically adds a dependency on the `initscripts-functions` package to packages that install an initscript that refers to `/etc/init.d/functions`. The recipe should really have an explicit `RDEPENDS`for the package in question on `initscripts-functions` so that the OpenEmbedded build system is able to ensure that the `initscripts` recipe is actually built and thus the `initscripts-functions` package is made available.

*   _`compile-host-path:`_  Checks the [`do_compile`][1906] log for indications that paths to locations on the build host were used. Using such paths might result in host contamination of the build output.

*   _`debug-deps:`_  Checks that all packages except `-dbg` packages do not depend on `-dbg` packages, which would cause a packaging bug.

*   _`debug-files:`_  Checks for `.debug` directories in anything but the `-dbg` package. The debug files should all be in the `-dbg` package. Thus, anything packaged elsewhere is incorrect packaging.

*   _`dep-cmp:`_  Checks for invalid version comparison statements in runtime dependency relationships between packages (i.e. in [`RDEPENDS`][1907], [`RRECOMMENDS`][1908],[`RSUGGESTS`][1909], [`RPROVIDES`][1910], [`RREPLACES`][1911], and [`RCONFLICTS`][1912] variable values). Any invalid comparisons might trigger failures or undesirable behavior when passed to the package manager.

*   _`desktop:`_  Runs the `desktop-file-validate` program against any `.desktop` files to validate their contents against the specification for `.desktop`files.

*   _`dev-deps:`_  Checks that all packages except `-dev` or `-staticdev` packages do not depend on `-dev` packages, which would be a packaging bug.

*   _`dev-so:`_  Checks that the `.so` symbolic links are in the `-dev` package and not in any of the other packages. In general, these symlinks are only useful for development purposes. Thus, the `-dev` package is the correct location for them. Some very rare cases do exist for dynamically loaded modules where these symlinks are needed instead in the main package.

*   _`file-rdeps:`_  Checks that file-level dependencies identified by the OpenEmbedded build system at packaging time are satisfied. For example, a shell script might start with the line `#!/bin/bash`. This line would translate to a file dependency on `/bin/bash`. Of the three package managers that the OpenEmbedded build system supports, only RPM directly handles file-level dependencies, resolving them automatically to packages providing the files. However, the lack of that functionality in the other two package managers does not mean the dependencies do not still need resolving. This QA check attempts to ensure that explicitly declared [`RDEPENDS`][1913] exist to handle any file-level dependency detected in packaged files.

*   _`files-invalid:`_  Checks for [`FILES`][1914] variable values that contain "//", which is invalid.

*   _`host-user-contaminated:`_  Checks that no package produced by the recipe contains any files outside of `/home` with a user or group ID that matches the user running BitBake. A match usually indicates that the files are being installed with an incorrect UID/GID, since target IDs are independent from host IDs. For additional information, see the section describing the [`do_install`][1915] task.

*   _`incompatible-license:`_  Report when packages are excluded from being created due to being marked with a license that is in[`INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE`][1916].

*   _`install-host-path:`_  Checks the [`do_install`][1917] log for indications that paths to locations on the build host were used. Using such paths might result in host contamination of the build output.

*   _`installed-vs-shipped:`_  Reports when files have been installed within `do_install` but have not been included in any package by way of the [`FILES`][1918]variable. Files that do not appear in any package cannot be present in an image later on in the build process. Ideally, all installed files should be packaged or not installed at all. These files can be deleted at the end of `do_install` if the files are not needed in any package.

*   _`invalid-chars:`_  Checks that the recipe metadata variables [`DESCRIPTION`][1919], [`SUMMARY`][1920], [`LICENSE`][1921], and [`SECTION`][1922] do not contain non-UTF-8 characters. Some package managers do not support such characters.

*   _`invalid-packageconfig:`_  Checks that no undefined features are being added to [`PACKAGECONFIG`][1923]. For example, any name "foo" for which the following form does not exist:

    ```
         PACKAGECONFIG[foo] = "..."

    ```

*   _`la:`_  Checks `.la` files for any `TMPDIR` paths. Any `.la` file containing these paths is incorrect since `libtool` adds the correct sysroot prefix when using the files automatically itself.

*   _`ldflags:`_  Ensures that the binaries were linked with the [`LDFLAGS`][1924] options provided by the build system. If this test fails, check that the `LDFLAGS`variable is being passed to the linker command.

*   _`libdir:`_  Checks for libraries being installed into incorrect (possibly hardcoded) installation paths. For example, this test will catch recipes that install`/lib/bar.so` when `${base_libdir}` is "lib32". Another example is when recipes install `/usr/lib64/foo.so` when `${libdir}` is "/usr/lib".

*   _`libexec:`_  Checks if a package contains files in `/usr/libexec`. This check is not performed if the `libexecdir` variable has been set explicitly to `/usr/libexec`.

*   _`packages-list:`_  Checks for the same package being listed multiple times through the [`PACKAGES`][1925] variable value. Installing the package in this manner can cause errors during packaging.

*   _`perm-config:`_  Reports lines in `fs-perms.txt` that have an invalid format.

*   _`perm-line:`_  Reports lines in `fs-perms.txt` that have an invalid format.

*   _`perm-link:`_  Reports lines in `fs-perms.txt` that specify 'link' where the specified target already exists.

*   _`perms:`_  Currently, this check is unused but reserved.

*   _`pkgconfig:`_  Checks `.pc` files for any [`TMPDIR`][1926]/[`WORKDIR`][1927] paths. Any `.pc` file containing these paths is incorrect since `pkg-config` itself adds the correct sysroot prefix when the files are accessed.

*   _`pkgname:`_  Checks that all packages in [`PACKAGES`][1928] have names that do not contain invalid characters (i.e. characters other than 0-9, a-z, ., +, and -).

*   _`pkgv-undefined:`_  Checks to see if the `PKGV` variable is undefined during [`do_package`][1929].

*   _`pkgvarcheck:`_  Checks through the variables [`RDEPENDS`][1930], [`RRECOMMENDS`][1931], [`RSUGGESTS`][1932], [`RCONFLICTS`][1933], [`RPROVIDES`][1934], [`RREPLACES`][1935], [`FILES`][1936], [`ALLOW_EMPTY`][1937],`pkg_preinst`, `pkg_postinst`, `pkg_prerm` and `pkg_postrm`, and reports if there are variable sets that are not package-specific. Using these variables without a package suffix is bad practice, and might unnecessarily complicate dependencies of other packages within the same recipe or have other unintended consequences.

*   _`pn-overrides:`_  Checks that a recipe does not have a name ([`PN`][1938]) value that appears in [`OVERRIDES`][1939]. If a recipe is named such that its `PN` value matches something already in `OVERRIDES` (e.g. `PN` happens to be the same as [`MACHINE`][1940] or [`DISTRO`][1941]), it can have unexpected consequences. For example, assignments such as `FILES_${PN} = "xyz"` effectively turn into `FILES = "xyz"`.

*   _`rpaths:`_  Checks for rpaths in the binaries that contain build system paths such as `TMPDIR`. If this test fails, bad `-rpath` options are being passed to the linker commands and your binaries have potential security issues.

*   _`split-strip:`_  Reports that splitting or stripping debug symbols from binaries has failed.

*   _`staticdev:`_  Checks for static library files (`*.a`) in non-`staticdev` packages.

*   _`symlink-to-sysroot:`_  Checks for symlinks in packages that point into [`TMPDIR`][1942] on the host. Such symlinks will work on the host, but are clearly invalid when running on the target.

*   _`textrel:`_  Checks for ELF binaries that contain relocations in their `.text` sections, which can result in a performance impact at runtime. See the explanation for the [`ELF binary`][1943] message for more information regarding runtime performance issues.

*   _`unsafe-references-in-scripts:`_  Reports when a script file installed in `${base_libdir}`, `${base_bindir}`, or `${base_sbindir}`, depends on files installed under `${exec_prefix}`. This dependency is a concern if you want the system to remain basically operable if `/usr` is mounted separately and is not mounted.

    ### Note

    Defaults for binaries installed in `${base_libdir}`, `${base_bindir}`, and `${base_sbindir}` are `/lib`, `/bin`, and `/sbin`, respectively. The default for a binary installed under `${exec_prefix}` is `/usr`.

*   _`useless-rpaths:`_  Checks for dynamic library load paths (rpaths) in the binaries that by default on a standard system are searched by the linker (e.g. `/lib` and `/usr/lib`). While these paths will not cause any breakage, they do waste space and are unnecessary.

*   _`var-undefined:`_  Reports when variables fundamental to packaging (i.e. [`WORKDIR`][1944], [`DEPLOY_DIR`][1945], [`D`][1946], [`PN`][1947], and [`PKGD`][1948]) are undefined during [`do_package`][1949].

*   _`version-going-backwards:`_  If Build History is enabled, reports when a package being written out has a lower version than the previously written package under the same name. If you are placing output packages into a feed and upgrading packages on a target system using that feed, the version of a package going backwards can result in the target system not correctly upgrading to the "new" version of the package.

    ### Note

    If you are not using runtime package management on your target system, then you do not need to worry about this situation.

*   _`xorg-driver-abi:`_  Checks that all packages containing Xorg drivers have ABI dependencies. The `xserver-xorg` recipe provides driver ABI names. All drivers should depend on the ABI versions that they have been built against. Driver recipes that include `xorg-driver-input.inc` or `xorg-driver-video.inc` will automatically get these versions. Consequently, you should only need to explicitly add dependencies to binary driver recipes.

### 8.61. `insserv.bbclass`[¶][1268]

The `insserv` class uses the `insserv` utility to update the order of symbolic links in `/etc/rc?.d/` within an image based on dependencies specified by LSB headers in the `init.d` scripts themselves.

### 8.62. `kernel.bbclass`[¶][1269]

The `kernel` class handles building Linux kernels. The class contains code to build all kernel trees. All needed headers are staged into the`[STAGING_KERNEL_DIR][4019]` directory to allow out-of-tree module builds using the [`module`][4343] class.

This means that each built kernel module is packaged separately and inter-module dependencies are created by parsing the `modinfo` output. If all modules are required, then installing the `kernel-modules` package installs all packages with modules and various other kernel packages such as`kernel-vmlinux`.

The `kernel` class contains logic that allows you to embed an initial RAM filesystem (initramfs) image when you build the kernel image. For information on how to build an initramfs, see the "[Building an Initial RAM Filesystem (initramfs) Image][4344]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

Various other classes are used by the `kernel` and `module` classes internally including the [`kernel-arch`][4345], [`module-base`][4346], and [`linux-kernel-base`][4347] classes.

### 8.63. `kernel-arch.bbclass`[¶][1270]

The `kernel-arch` class sets the `ARCH` environment variable for Linux kernel compilation (including modules).

### 8.64. `kernel-fitimage.bbclass`[¶][1271]

The `kernel-fitimage` class provides support to pack zImages.

### 8.65. `kernel-grub.bbclass`[¶][1272]

The `kernel-grub` class updates the boot area and the boot menu with the kernel as the priority boot mechanism while installing a RPM to update the kernel on a deployed target.

### 8.66. `kernel-module-split.bbclass`[¶][1273]

The `kernel-module-split` class provides common functionality for splitting Linux kernel modules into separate packages.

### 8.67. `kernel-uboot.bbclass`[¶][1274]

The `kernel-uboot` class provides support for building from vmlinux-style kernel sources.

### 8.68. `kernel-uimage.bbclass`[¶][1275]

The `kernel-uimage` class provides support to pack uImage.

### 8.69. `kernel-yocto.bbclass`[¶][1276]

The `kernel-yocto` class provides common functionality for building from linux-yocto style kernel source repositories.

### 8.70. `kernelsrc.bbclass`[¶][1277]

The `kernelsrc` class sets the Linux kernel source and version.

### 8.71. `lib_package.bbclass`[¶][1278]

The `lib_package` class supports recipes that build libraries and produce executable binaries, where those binaries should not be installed by default along with the library. Instead, the binaries are added to a separate `${`[`PN`][4348]`}-bin` package to make their installation optional.

### 8.72. `libc*.bbclass`[¶][1279]

The `libc*` classes support recipes that build packages with `libc`:

*   The `libc-common` class provides common support for building with `libc`.

*   The `libc-package` class supports packaging up `glibc` and `eglibc`.

### 8.73. `license.bbclass`[¶][1280]

The `license` class provides license manifest creation and license exclusion. This class is enabled by default using the default value for the[`INHERIT_DISTRO`][4349] variable.

### 8.74. `linux-kernel-base.bbclass`[¶][1281]

The `linux-kernel-base` class provides common functionality for recipes that build out of the Linux kernel source tree. These builds goes beyond the kernel itself. For example, the Perf recipe also inherits this class.

### 8.75. `linuxloader.bbclass`[¶][1282]

Provides the function `linuxloader()`, which gives the value of the dynamic loader/linker provided on the platform. This value is used by a number of other classes.

### 8.76. `logging.bbclass`[¶][1283]

The `logging` class provides the standard shell functions used to log messages for various BitBake severity levels (i.e. `bbplain`, `bbnote`, `bbwarn`, `bberror`, `bbfatal`, and `bbdebug`).

This class is enabled by default since it is inherited by the `base` class.

### 8.77. `meta.bbclass`[¶][1284]

The `meta` class is inherited by recipes that do not build any output packages themselves, but act as a "meta" target for building other recipes.

### 8.78. `metadata_scm.bbclass`[¶][1285]

The `metadata_scm` class provides functionality for querying the branch and revision of a Source Code Manager (SCM) repository.

The [`base`][4350] class uses this class to print the revisions of each layer before starting every build. The `metadata_scm` class is enabled by default because it is inherited by the `base` class.

### 8.79. `migrate_localcount.bbclass`[¶][1286]

The `migrate_localcount` class verifies a recipe's localcount data and increments it appropriately.

### 8.80. `mime.bbclass`[¶][1287]

The `mime` class generates the proper post-install and post-remove (postinst/postrm) scriptlets for packages that install MIME type files. These scriptlets call `update-mime-database` to add the MIME types to the shared database.

### 8.81. `mirrors.bbclass`[¶][1288]

The `mirrors` class sets up some standard [`MIRRORS`][4351] entries for source code mirrors. These mirrors provide a fall-back path in case the upstream source specified in [`SRC_URI`][4352] within recipes is unavailable.

This class is enabled by default since it is inherited by the [`base`][4353] class.

### 8.82. `module.bbclass`[¶][1289]

The `module` class provides support for building out-of-tree Linux kernel modules. The class inherits the [`module-base`][4354] and [`kernel-module-split`][4355]classes, and implements the [`do_compile`][4356] and [`do_install`][4357] tasks. The class provides everything needed to build and package a kernel module.

For general information on out-of-tree Linux kernel modules, see the "[Incorporating Out-of-Tree Modules][4358]" section in the Yocto Project Linux Kernel Development Manual.

### 8.83. `module-base.bbclass`[¶][1290]

The `module-base` class provides the base functionality for building Linux kernel modules. Typically, a recipe that builds software that includes one or more kernel modules and has its own means of building the module inherits this class as opposed to inheriting the [`module`][4359] class.

### 8.84. `multilib*.bbclass`[¶][1291]

The `multilib*` classes provide support for building libraries with different target optimizations or target architectures and installing them side-by-side in the same image.

For more information on using the Multilib feature, see the "[Combining Multiple Versions of Library Files into One Image][4360]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

### 8.85. `native.bbclass`[¶][1292]

The `native` class provides common functionality for recipes that wish to build tools to run on the build host (i.e. tools that use the compiler or other tools from the build host).

You can create a recipe that builds tools that run natively on the host a couple different ways:

*   Create a  _`myrecipe`_ `-native.bb` that inherits the `native` class. If you use this method, you must order the inherit statement in the recipe after all other inherit statements so that the `native` class is inherited last.

*   Create or modify a target recipe that contains the following:

    ```
         BBCLASSEXTEND = "native"

    ```

    Inside the recipe, use `_class-native` and `_class-target` overrides to specify any functionality specific to the respective native or target case.

### Warning

When creating a recipe, you must follow this naming convention:
```
     native-myrecipe.bb

```
Not doing so can lead to subtle problems because code exists that depends on the naming convention.

Although applied differently, the `native` class is used with both methods. The advantage of the second method is that you do not need to have two separate recipes (assuming you need both) for native and target. All common parts of the recipe are automatically shared.

### 8.86. `nativesdk.bbclass`[¶][1293]

The `nativesdk` class provides common functionality for recipes that wish to build tools to run as part of an SDK (i.e. tools that run on [`SDKMACHINE`][4361]).

You can create a recipe that builds tools that run on the SDK machine a couple different ways:

*   Create a `nativesdk-` _`myrecipe`_ `.bb` recipe that inherits the `nativesdk` class. If you use this method, you must order the inherit statement in the recipe after all other inherit statements so that the `nativesdk` class is inherited last.

*   Create a `nativesdk` variant of any recipe by adding the following:

    ```
         BBCLASSEXTEND = "nativesdk"

    ```

    Inside the recipe, use `_class-nativesdk` and `_class-target` overrides to specify any functionality specific to the respective SDK machine or target case.

### Warning

When creating a recipe, you must follow this naming convention:
```
     nativesdk-myrecipe.bb

```
Not doing so can lead to subtle problems because code exists that depends on the naming convention.

Although applied differently, the `nativesdk` class is used with both methods. The advantage of the second method is that you do not need to have two separate recipes (assuming you need both) for the SDK machine and the target. All common parts of the recipe are automatically shared.

### 8.87. `nopackages.bbclass`[¶][1294]

Disables packaging tasks for those recipes and classes where packaging is not needed.

### 8.88. `npm.bbclass`[¶][1295]

Provides support for building Node.js software fetched using the npm package manager.

### Note

Currently, recipes inheriting this class must use the `npm://` fetcher to have dependencies fetched and packaged automatically.

### 8.89. `oelint.bbclass`[¶][1296]

The `oelint` class is an obsolete lint checking tool that exists in `meta/classes` in the [Source Directory][4362].

A number of classes exist that could be generally useful in OE-Core but are never actually used within OE-Core itself. The `oelint` class is one such example. However, being aware of this class can reduce the proliferation of different versions of similar classes across multiple layers.

### 8.90. `own-mirrors.bbclass`[¶][1297]

The `own-mirrors` class makes it easier to set up your own [`PREMIRRORS`][4363] from which to first fetch source before attempting to fetch it from the upstream specified in [`SRC_URI`][4364] within each recipe.

To use this class, inherit it globally and specify [`SOURCE_MIRROR_URL`][4365]. Here is an example:

```
     INHERIT += "own-mirrors"
     SOURCE_MIRROR_URL = "http://example.com/my-source-mirror"

```

You can specify only a single URL in `SOURCE_MIRROR_URL`.

### 8.91. `package.bbclass`[¶][1298]

The `package` class supports generating packages from a build's output. The core generic functionality is in `package.bbclass`. The code specific to particular package types resides in these package-specific classes: [`package_deb`][4366], [`package_rpm`][4367], [`package_ipk`][4368], and [`package_tar`][4369].

### Warning

The `package_tar` class is broken and not supported. It is recommended that you do not use this class.

You can control the list of resulting package formats by using the `[PACKAGE_CLASSES][4020]` variable defined in your `conf/local.conf` configuration file, which is located in the [Build Directory][4370]. When defining the variable, you can specify one or more package types. Since images are generated from packages, a packaging class is needed to enable image generation. The first class listed in this variable is used for image generation.

If you take the optional step to set up a repository (package feed) on the development host that can be used by DNF, you can install packages from the feed while you are running the image on the target (i.e. runtime installation of packages). For more information, see the "[Using Runtime Package Management][4371]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

The package-specific class you choose can affect build-time performance and has space ramifications. In general, building a package with IPK takes about thirty percent less time as compared to using RPM to build the same or similar package. This comparison takes into account a complete build of the package with all dependencies previously built. The reason for this discrepancy is because the RPM package manager creates and processes more[Metadata][4372] than the IPK package manager. Consequently, you might consider setting `PACKAGE_CLASSES` to "package_ipk" if you are building smaller systems.

Before making your package manager decision, however, you should consider some further things about using RPM:

*   RPM starts to provide more abilities than IPK due to the fact that it processes more Metadata. For example, this information includes individual file types, file checksum generation and evaluation on install, sparse file support, conflict detection and resolution for Multilib systems, ACID style upgrade, and repackaging abilities for rollbacks.

*   For smaller systems, the extra space used for the Berkeley Database and the amount of metadata when using RPM can affect your ability to perform on-device upgrades.

You can find additional information on the effects of the package class at these two Yocto Project mailing list links:

*   [https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/poky/2011-May/006362.html][1952]

*   [https://lists.yoctoproject.org/pipermail/poky/2011-May/006363.html][1953]

### 8.92. `package_deb.bbclass`[¶][1299]

The `package_deb` class provides support for creating packages that use the Debian (i.e. `.deb`) file format. The class ensures the packages are written out in a `.deb` file format to the `${`[`DEPLOY_DIR_DEB`][4373]`}` directory.

This class inherits the [`package`][4374] class and is enabled through the [`PACKAGE_CLASSES`][4375] variable in the `local.conf` file.

### 8.93. `package_ipk.bbclass`[¶][1300]

The `package_ipk` class provides support for creating packages that use the IPK (i.e. `.ipk`) file format. The class ensures the packages are written out in a `.ipk` file format to the `${`[`DEPLOY_DIR_IPK`][4376]`}` directory.

This class inherits the [`package`][4377] class and is enabled through the [`PACKAGE_CLASSES`][4378] variable in the `local.conf` file.

### 8.94. `package_rpm.bbclass`[¶][1301]

The `package_rpm` class provides support for creating packages that use the RPM (i.e. `.rpm`) file format. The class ensures the packages are written out in a `.rpm` file format to the `${`[`DEPLOY_DIR_RPM`][4379]`}` directory.

This class inherits the [`package`][4380] class and is enabled through the [`PACKAGE_CLASSES`][4381] variable in the `local.conf` file.

### 8.95. `package_tar.bbclass`[¶][1302]

The `package_tar` class provides support for creating tarballs. The class ensures the packages are written out in a tarball format to the`${`[`DEPLOY_DIR_TAR`][4382]`}` directory.

This class inherits the [`package`][4383] class and is enabled through the [`PACKAGE_CLASSES`][4384] variable in the `local.conf` file.

### Note

You cannot specify the `package_tar` class first using the `PACKAGE_CLASSES` variable. You must use `.deb`, `.ipk`, or `.rpm` file formats for your image or SDK.

### 8.96. `packagedata.bbclass`[¶][1303]

The `packagedata` class provides common functionality for reading `pkgdata` files found in [`PKGDATA_DIR`][4385]. These files contain information about each output package produced by the OpenEmbedded build system.

This class is enabled by default because it is inherited by the [`package`][4386] class.

### 8.97. `packagegroup.bbclass`[¶][1304]

The `packagegroup` class sets default values appropriate for package group recipes (e.g. `[PACKAGES][4021]`, `[PACKAGE_ARCH][4022]`, `[ALLOW_EMPTY][4023]`, and so forth). It is highly recommended that all package group recipes inherit this class.

For information on how to use this class, see the "[Customizing Images Using Custom Package Groups][4387]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

Previously, this class was called the `task` class.

### 8.98. `patch.bbclass`[¶][1305]

The `patch` class provides all functionality for applying patches during the [`do_patch`][4388] task.

This class is enabled by default because it is inherited by the [`base`][4389] class.

### 8.99. `perlnative.bbclass`[¶][1306]

When inherited by a recipe, the `perlnative` class supports using the native version of Perl built by the build system rather than using the version provided by the build host.

### 8.100. `pixbufcache.bbclass`[¶][1307]

The `pixbufcache` class generates the proper post-install and post-remove (postinst/postrm) scriptlets for packages that install pixbuf loaders, which are used with `gdk-pixbuf`. These scriptlets call `update_pixbuf_cache` to add the pixbuf loaders to the cache. Since the cache files are architecture-specific, `update_pixbuf_cache` is run using QEMU if the postinst scriptlets need to be run on the build host during image creation.

If the pixbuf loaders being installed are in packages other than the recipe's main package, set [`PIXBUF_PACKAGES`][4390] to specify the packages containing the loaders.

### 8.101. `pkgconfig.bbclass`[¶][1308]

The `pkgconfig` class provides a standard way to get header and library information by using `pkg-config`. This class aims to smooth integration of`pkg-config` into libraries that use it.

During staging, BitBake installs `pkg-config` data into the `sysroots/` directory. By making use of sysroot functionality within `pkg-config`, the `pkgconfig` class no longer has to manipulate the files.

### 8.102. `populate_sdk.bbclass`[¶][1309]

The `populate_sdk` class provides support for SDK-only recipes. For information on advantages gained when building a cross-development toolchain using the [`do_populate_sdk`][4391] task, see the "[Building an SDK Installer][4392]" section in the Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK) Developer's Guide.

### 8.103. `populate_sdk_*.bbclass`[¶][1310]

The `populate_sdk_*` classes support SDK creation and consist of the following classes:

*   _`populate_sdk_base`:_  The base class supporting SDK creation under all package managers (i.e. DEB, RPM, and opkg).

*   _`populate_sdk_deb`:_  Supports creation of the SDK given the Debian package manager.

*   _`populate_sdk_rpm`:_  Supports creation of the SDK given the RPM package manager.

*   _`populate_sdk_ipk`:_  Supports creation of the SDK given the opkg (IPK format) package manager.

*   _`populate_sdk_ext`:_  Supports extensible SDK creation under all package managers.

The `populate_sdk_base` class inherits the appropriate `populate_sdk_*` (i.e. `deb`, `rpm`, and `ipk`) based on [`IMAGE_PKGTYPE`][4393].

The base class ensures all source and destination directories are established and then populates the SDK. After populating the SDK, the `populate_sdk_base` class constructs two sysroots: `${`[`SDK_ARCH`][4394]`}-nativesdk`, which contains the cross-compiler and associated tooling, and the target, which contains a target root filesystem that is configured for the SDK usage. These two images reside in [`SDK_OUTPUT`][4395], which consists of the following:

```
     ${SDK_OUTPUT}/${SDK_ARCH}-nativesdk-pkgs
     ${SDK_OUTPUT}/${SDKTARGETSYSROOT}/target-pkgs

```

Finally, the base populate SDK class creates the toolchain environment setup script, the tarball of the SDK, and the installer.

The respective `populate_sdk_deb`, `populate_sdk_rpm`, and `populate_sdk_ipk` classes each support the specific type of SDK. These classes are inherited by and used with the `populate_sdk_base` class.

For more information on the cross-development toolchain generation, see the "[Cross-Development Toolchain Generation][4396]" section. For information on advantages gained when building a cross-development toolchain using the [`do_populate_sdk`][4397] task, see the "[Building an SDK Installer][4398]" section in the Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK) Developer's Guide.

### 8.104. `prexport.bbclass`[¶][1311]

The `prexport` class provides functionality for exporting [`PR`][4399] values.

### Note

This class is not intended to be used directly. Rather, it is enabled when using "`bitbake-prserv-tool export`".

### 8.105. `primport.bbclass`[¶][1312]

The `primport` class provides functionality for importing [`PR`][4400] values.

### Note

This class is not intended to be used directly. Rather, it is enabled when using "`bitbake-prserv-tool import`".

### 8.106. `prserv.bbclass`[¶][1313]

The `prserv` class provides functionality for using a [PR service][4401] in order to automatically manage the incrementing of the [`PR`][4402] variable for each recipe.

This class is enabled by default because it is inherited by the [`package`][4403] class. However, the OpenEmbedded build system will not enable the functionality of this class unless [`PRSERV_HOST`][4404] has been set.

### 8.107. `ptest.bbclass`[¶][1314]

The `ptest` class provides functionality for packaging and installing runtime tests for recipes that build software that provides these tests.

This class is intended to be inherited by individual recipes. However, the class' functionality is largely disabled unless "ptest" appears in[`DISTRO_FEATURES`][4405]. See the "[Testing Packages With ptest][4406]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual for more information on ptest.

### 8.108. `ptest-gnome.bbclass`[¶][1315]

Enables package tests (ptests) specifically for GNOME packages, which have tests intended to be executed with `gnome-desktop-testing`.

For information on setting up and running ptests, see the "[Testing Packages With ptest][4407]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

### 8.109. `python-dir.bbclass`[¶][1316]

The `python-dir` class provides the base version, location, and site package location for Python.

### 8.110. `python3native.bbclass`[¶][1317]

The `python3native` class supports using the native version of Python 3 built by the build system rather than support of the version provided by the build host.

### 8.111. `pythonnative.bbclass`[¶][1318]

When inherited by a recipe, the `pythonnative` class supports using the native version of Python built by the build system rather than using the version provided by the build host.

### 8.112. `qemu.bbclass`[¶][1319]

The `qemu` class provides functionality for recipes that either need QEMU or test for the existence of QEMU. Typically, this class is used to run programs for a target system on the build host using QEMU's application emulation mode.

### 8.113. `recipe_sanity.bbclass`[¶][1320]

The `recipe_sanity` class checks for the presence of any host system recipe prerequisites that might affect the build (e.g. variables that are set or software that is present).

### 8.114. `relocatable.bbclass`[¶][1321]

The `relocatable` class enables relocation of binaries when they are installed into the sysroot.

This class makes use of the [`chrpath`][4408] class and is used by both the [`cross`][4409] and [`native`][4410] classes.

### 8.115. `remove-libtool.bbclass`[¶][1322]

The `remove-libtool` class adds a post function to the [`do_install`][4411] task to remove all `.la` files installed by `libtool`. Removing these files results in them being absent from both the sysroot and target packages.

If a recipe needs the `.la` files to be installed, then the recipe can override the removal by setting `REMOVE_LIBTOOL_LA` to "0" as follows:

```
     REMOVE_LIBTOOL_LA = "0"

```

### Note

The `remove-libtool` class is not enabled by default.

### 8.116. `report-error.bbclass`[¶][1323]

The `report-error` class supports enabling the [error reporting tool][4412], which allows you to submit build error information to a central database.

The class collects debug information for recipe, recipe version, task, machine, distro, build system, target system, host distro, branch, commit, and log. From the information, report files using a JSON format are created and stored in `${`[`LOG_DIR`][4413]`}/error-report`.

### 8.117. `rm_work.bbclass`[¶][1324]

The `rm_work` class supports deletion of temporary workspace, which can ease your hard drive demands during builds.

The OpenEmbedded build system can use a substantial amount of disk space during the build process. A portion of this space is the work files under the `${TMPDIR}/work` directory for each recipe. Once the build system generates the packages for a recipe, the work files for that recipe are no longer needed. However, by default, the build system preserves these files for inspection and possible debugging purposes. If you would rather have these files deleted to save disk space as the build progresses, you can enable `rm_work` by adding the following to your `local.conf` file, which is found in the[Build Directory][4414].

```
    INHERIT += "rm_work"

```

If you are modifying and building source code out of the work directory for a recipe, enabling `rm_work` will potentially result in your changes to the source being lost. To exclude some recipes from having their work directories deleted by `rm_work`, you can add the names of the recipe or recipes you are working on to the `RM_WORK_EXCLUDE` variable, which can also be set in your `local.conf` file. Here is an example:

```
    RM_WORK_EXCLUDE += "busybox glibc"

```

### 8.118. `rootfs*.bbclass`[¶][1325]

The `rootfs*` classes support creating the root filesystem for an image and consist of the following classes:

*   The `rootfs-postcommands` class, which defines filesystem post-processing functions for image recipes.

*   The `rootfs_deb` class, which supports creation of root filesystems for images built using `.deb` packages.

*   The `rootfs_rpm` class, which supports creation of root filesystems for images built using `.rpm` packages.

*   The `rootfs_ipk` class, which supports creation of root filesystems for images built using `.ipk` packages.

*   The `rootfsdebugfiles` class, which installs additional files found on the build host directly into the root filesystem.

The root filesystem is created from packages using one of the `rootfs*.bbclass` files as determined by the [`PACKAGE_CLASSES`][4415] variable.

For information on how root filesystem images are created, see the "[Image Generation][4416]" section.

### 8.119. `sanity.bbclass`[¶][1326]

The `sanity` class checks to see if prerequisite software is present on the host system so that users can be notified of potential problems that might affect their build. The class also performs basic user configuration checks from the `local.conf` configuration file to prevent common mistakes that cause build failures. Distribution policy usually determines whether to include this class.

### 8.120. `scons.bbclass`[¶][1327]

The `scons` class supports recipes that need to build software that uses the SCons build system. You can use the [`EXTRA_OESCONS`][4417] variable to specify additional configuration options you want to pass SCons command line.

### 8.121. `sdl.bbclass`[¶][1328]

The `sdl` class supports recipes that need to build software that uses the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library.

### 8.122. `setuptools.bbclass`[¶][1329]

The `setuptools` class supports Python version 2.x extensions that use build systems based on `setuptools`. If your recipe uses these build systems, the recipe needs to inherit the `setuptools` class.

### 8.123. `setuptools3.bbclass`[¶][1330]

The `setuptools3` class supports Python version 3.x extensions that use build systems based on `setuptools3`. If your recipe uses these build systems, the recipe needs to inherit the `setuptools3` class.

### 8.124. `sign_rpm.bbclass`[¶][1331]

The `sign_rpm` class supports generating signed RPM packages.

### 8.125. `sip.bbclass`[¶][1332]

The `sip` class supports recipes that build or package SIP-based Python bindings.

### 8.126. `siteconfig.bbclass`[¶][1333]

The `siteconfig` class provides functionality for handling site configuration. The class is used by the [`autotools`][4418] class to accelerate the [`do_configure`][4419]task.

### 8.127. `siteinfo.bbclass`[¶][1334]

The `siteinfo` class provides information about the targets that might be needed by other classes or recipes.

As an example, consider Autotools, which can require tests that must execute on the target hardware. Since this is not possible in general when cross compiling, site information is used to provide cached test results so these tests can be skipped over but still make the correct values available. The`[meta/site directory][4024]` contains test results sorted into different categories such as architecture, endianness, and the `libc` used. Site information provides a list of files containing data relevant to the current build in the `[CONFIG_SITE][4025]` variable that Autotools automatically picks up.

The class also provides variables like `[SITEINFO_ENDIANNESS][4026]` and `[SITEINFO_BITS][4027]` that can be used elsewhere in the metadata.

Because the [`base`][4420] class includes the `siteinfo` class, it is always active.

### 8.128. `spdx.bbclass`[¶][1335]

The `spdx` class integrates real-time license scanning, generation of SPDX standard output, and verification of license information during the build.

### Note

This class is currently at the prototype stage in the 1.6 release.

### 8.129. `sstate.bbclass`[¶][1336]

The `sstate` class provides support for Shared State (sstate). By default, the class is enabled through the [`INHERIT_DISTRO`][4421] variable's default value.

For more information on sstate, see the "[Shared State Cache][4422]" section.

### 8.130. `staging.bbclass`[¶][1337]

The `staging` class installs files into individual recipe work directories for sysroots. The class contains the following key tasks:

*   The [`do_populate_sysroot`][1954] task, which is responsible for handing the files that end up in the recipe sysroots.

*   The [`do_prepare_recipe_sysroot`][1955] task (a "partner" task to the `populate_sysroot` task), which installs the files into the individual recipe work directories (i.e. [`WORKDIR`][1956]).

The code in the `staging` class is complex and basically works in two stages:

*   _Stage One:_  The first stage addresses recipes that have files they want to share with other recipes that have dependencies on the originating recipe. Normally these dependencies are installed through the [`do_install`][1957] task into `${`[`D`][1958]`}`. The `do_populate_sysroot` task copies a subset of these files into `${SYSROOT_DESTDIR}`. This subset of files is controlled by the [`SYSROOT_DIRS`][1959], [`SYSROOT_DIRS_NATIVE`][1960], and [`SYSROOT_DIRS_BLACKLIST`][1961]variables.

    ### Note

    Additionally, a recipe can customize the files further by declaring a processing function in the [`SYSROOT_PREPROCESS_FUNCS`][1962]variable.

    A shared state (sstate) object is built from these files and the files are placed into a subdirectory of `tmp/sysroot-components/`. The files are scanned for hardcoded paths to the original installation location. If the location is found in text files, the hardcoded locations are replaced by tokens and a list of the files needing such replacements is created. These adjustments are referred to as "FIXMEs". The list of files that are scanned for paths is controlled by the [`SSTATE_SCAN_FILES`][1963] variable.

*   _Stage Two:_  The second stage addresses recipes that want to use something from another recipe and declare a dependency on that recipe through the [`DEPENDS`][1964] variable. The recipe will have a [`do_prepare_recipe_sysroot`][1965] task and when this task executes, it creates the `recipe-sysroot` and`recipe-sysroot-native` in the recipe work directory (i.e. [`WORKDIR`][1966]. The OpenEmbedded build system creates hard links to copies of the relevant files from `sysroot-components` into the recipe work directory.

    ### Note

    If hard links are not possible, the build system uses actual copies.

    The build system then addresses any "FIXMEs" to paths as defined from the list created in the first stage.

    Finally, any files in `${bindir}` within the sysroot that have the prefix "`postinst-`" are executed.

    ### Note

    Although these files are not recommended for general use, the files do allow some issues such as user creation and module indexes to be addressed.

    Because recipes can have other dependencies outside of `DEPENDS` (e.g. `do_unpack[depends] += "tar-native:do_populate_sysroot"`), the sysroot creation function `extend_recipe_sysroot` is also added as a pre-function for those tasks whose dependencies are not through `DEPENDS` but operate similarly.

    When installing dependencies into the sysroot, the code traverses the dependency graph and processes dependencies in exactly the same way as the dependencies would or would not be when installed from sstate. This processing means, for example, a native tool would have its native dependencies added but a target library would not have its dependencies traversed or installed. The same sstate dependency code is used so that builds should be identical regardless of whether sstate was used or not. For a closer look, see the `setscene_depvalid()` function in the [`sstate`][1967]class.

    The build system is careful to maintain manifests of the files it installs so that any given dependency can be installed as needed. The sstate hash of the installed item is also stored so that if it changes, the build system can reinstall it.

### 8.131. `syslinux.bbclass`[¶][1338]

The `syslinux` class provides syslinux-specific functions for building bootable images.

The class supports the following variables:

*   [`INITRD`][1968]: Indicates list of filesystem images to concatenate and use as an initial RAM disk (initrd). This variable is optional.

*   [`ROOTFS`][1969]: Indicates a filesystem image to include as the root filesystem. This variable is optional.

*   [`AUTO_SYSLINUXMENU`][1970]: Enables creating an automatic menu when set to "1".

*   [`LABELS`][1971]: Lists targets for automatic configuration.

*   [`APPEND`][1972]: Lists append string overrides for each label.

*   [`SYSLINUX_OPTS`][1973]: Lists additional options to add to the syslinux file. Semicolon characters separate multiple options.

*   [`SYSLINUX_SPLASH`][1974]: Lists a background for the VGA boot menu when you are using the boot menu.

*   [`SYSLINUX_DEFAULT_CONSOLE`][1975]: Set to "console=ttyX" to change kernel boot default console.

*   [`SYSLINUX_SERIAL`][1976]: Sets an alternate serial port. Or, turns off serial when the variable is set with an empty string.

*   [`SYSLINUX_SERIAL_TTY`][1977]: Sets an alternate "console=tty..." kernel boot argument.

### 8.132. `systemd.bbclass`[¶][1339]

The `systemd` class provides support for recipes that install systemd unit files.

The functionality for this class is disabled unless you have "systemd" in [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][4423].

Under this class, the recipe or Makefile (i.e. whatever the recipe is calling during the [`do_install`][4424] task) installs unit files into`${`[`D`][4425]`}${systemd_unitdir}/system`. If the unit files being installed go into packages other than the main package, you need to set [`SYSTEMD_PACKAGES`][4426]in your recipe to identify the packages in which the files will be installed.

You should set [`SYSTEMD_SERVICE`][4427] to the name of the service file. You should also use a package name override to indicate the package to which the value applies. If the value applies to the recipe's main package, use `${`[`PN`][4428]`}`. Here is an example from the connman recipe:

```
     SYSTEMD_SERVICE_${PN} = "connman.service"

```

Services are set up to start on boot automatically unless you have set [`SYSTEMD_AUTO_ENABLE`][4429] to "disable".

For more information on `systemd`, see the "[Selecting an Initialization Manager][4430]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

### 8.133. `systemd-boot.bbclass`[¶][1340]

The `systemd-boot` class provides functions specific to the systemd-boot bootloader for building bootable images. This is an internal class and is not intended to be used directly.

### Note

The `systemd-boot` class is a result from merging the `gummiboot` class used in previous Yocto Project releases with the `systemd`project.

Set the [`EFI_PROVIDER`][4431] variable to "systemd-boot" to use this class. Doing so creates a standalone EFI bootloader that is not dependent on systemd.

For information on more variables used and supported in this class, see the [`SYSTEMD_BOOT_CFG`][4432], [`SYSTEMD_BOOT_ENTRIES`][4433], and [`SYSTEMD_BOOT_TIMEOUT`][4434]variables.

You can also see the [Systemd-boot documentation][4435] for more information.

### 8.134. `terminal.bbclass`[¶][1341]

The `terminal` class provides support for starting a terminal session. The [`OE_TERMINAL`][4436] variable controls which terminal emulator is used for the session.

Other classes use the `terminal` class anywhere a separate terminal session needs to be started. For example, the [`patch`][4437] class assuming [`PATCHRESOLVE`][4438]is set to "user", the [`cml1`][4439] class, and the [`devshell`][4440] class all use the `terminal` class.

### 8.135. `testimage*.bbclass`[¶][1342]

The `testimage*` classes support running automated tests against images using QEMU and on actual hardware. The classes handle loading the tests and starting the image. To use the classes, you need to perform steps to set up the environment.

The tests are commands that run on the target system over `ssh`. Each test is written in Python and makes use of the `unittest` module.

The `testimage.bbclass` runs tests on an image when called using the following:

```
     $ bitbake -c testimage image

```

The `testimage-auto` class runs tests on an image after the image is constructed (i.e. [`TEST_IMAGE`][4441] must be set to "1").

For information on how to enable, run, and create new tests, see the "[Performing Automated Runtime Testing][4442]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

### 8.136. `testsdk.bbclass`[¶][1343]

This class supports running automated tests against software development kits (SDKs). The `testsdk` class runs tests on an SDK when called using the following:

```
     $ bitbake -c testsdk image

```

### 8.137. `texinfo.bbclass`[¶][1344]

This class should be inherited by recipes whose upstream packages invoke the `texinfo` utilities at build-time. Native and cross recipes are made to use the dummy scripts provided by `texinfo-dummy-native`, for improved performance. Target architecture recipes use the genuine Texinfo utilities. By default, they use the Texinfo utilities on the host system.

### Note

If you want to use the Texinfo recipe shipped with the build system, you can remove "texinfo-native" from [`ASSUME_PROVIDED`][4443] and makeinfo from [`SANITY_REQUIRED_UTILITIES`][4444].

### 8.138. `tinderclient.bbclass`[¶][1345]

The `tinderclient` class submits build results to an external Tinderbox instance.

### Note

This class is currently unmaintained.

### 8.139. `toaster.bbclass`[¶][1346]

The `toaster` class collects information about packages and images and sends them as events that the BitBake user interface can receive. The class is enabled when the Toaster user interface is running.

This class is not intended to be used directly.

### 8.140. `toolchain-scripts.bbclass`[¶][1347]

The `toolchain-scripts` class provides the scripts used for setting up the environment for installed SDKs.

### 8.141. `typecheck.bbclass`[¶][1348]

The `typecheck` class provides support for validating the values of variables set at the configuration level against their defined types. The OpenEmbedded build system allows you to define the type of a variable using the "type" varflag. Here is an example:

```
     IMAGE_FEATURES[type] = "list"

```

### 8.142. `uboot-config.bbclass`[¶][1349]

The `uboot-config` class provides support for U-Boot configuration for a machine. Specify the machine in your recipe as follows:

```
     UBOOT_CONFIG ??= <default>
     UBOOT_CONFIG[foo] = "config,images"

```

You can also specify the machine using this method:

```
     UBOOT_MACHINE = "config"

```

See the [`UBOOT_CONFIG`][4445] and [`UBOOT_MACHINE`][4446] variables for additional information.

### 8.143. `uninative.bbclass`[¶][1350]

Attempts to isolate the build system from the host distribution's C library in order to make re-use of native shared state artifacts across different host distributions practical. With this class enabled, a tarball containing a pre-built C library is downloaded at the start of the build. In the Poky reference distribution this is enabled by default through `meta/conf/distro/include/yocto-uninative.inc`. Other distributions that do not derive from poky can also "`require conf/distro/include/yocto-uninative.inc`" to use this. Alternatively if you prefer, you can build the uninative-tarball recipe yourself, publish the resulting tarball (e.g. via HTTP) and set `UNINATIVE_URL` and `UNINATIVE_CHECKSUM` appropriately. For an example, see the`meta/conf/distro/include/yocto-uninative.inc`.

The `uninative` class is also used unconditionally by the extensible SDK. When building the extensible SDK, `uninative-tarball` is built and the resulting tarball is included within the SDK.

### 8.144. `update-alternatives.bbclass`[¶][1351]

The `update-alternatives` class helps the alternatives system when multiple sources provide the same command. This situation occurs when several programs that have the same or similar function are installed with the same name. For example, the `ar` command is available from the `busybox`, `binutils` and `elfutils` packages. The `update-alternatives` class handles renaming the binaries so that multiple packages can be installed without conflicts. The `ar` command still works regardless of which packages are installed or subsequently removed. The class renames the conflicting binary in each package and symlinks the highest priority binary during installation or removal of packages.

To use this class, you need to define a number of variables:

*   [`ALTERNATIVE`][1978]

*   [`ALTERNATIVE_LINK_NAME`][1979]

*   [`ALTERNATIVE_TARGET`][1980]

*   [`ALTERNATIVE_PRIORITY`][1981]

These variables list alternative commands needed by a package, provide pathnames for links, default links for targets, and so forth. For details on how to use this class, see the comments in the [`update-alternatives.bbclass`][4447].

### Note

You can use the `update-alternatives` command directly in your recipes. However, this class simplifies things in most cases.

### 8.145. `update-rc.d.bbclass`[¶][1352]

The `update-rc.d` class uses `update-rc.d` to safely install an initialization script on behalf of the package. The OpenEmbedded build system takes care of details such as making sure the script is stopped before a package is removed and started when the package is installed.

Three variables control this class: `[INITSCRIPT_PACKAGES][4028]`, `[INITSCRIPT_NAME][4029]` and `[INITSCRIPT_PARAMS][4030]`. See the variable links for details.

### 8.146. `useradd*.bbclass`[¶][1353]

The `useradd*` classes support the addition of users or groups for usage by the package on the target. For example, if you have packages that contain system services that should be run under their own user or group, you can use these classes to enable creation of the user or group. The `meta-skeleton/recipes-skeleton/useradd/useradd-example.bb` recipe in the [Source Directory][4448] provides a simple example that shows how to add three users and groups to two packages. See the `useradd-example.bb` recipe for more information on how to use these classes.

The `useradd_base` class provides basic functionality for user or groups settings.

The `useradd*` classes support the [`USERADD_PACKAGES`][4449], [`USERADD_PARAM`][4450], [`GROUPADD_PARAM`][4451], and [`GROUPMEMS_PARAM`][4452] variables.

The `useradd-staticids` class supports the addition of users or groups that have static user identification (`uid`) and group identification (`gid`) values.

The default behavior of the OpenEmbedded build system for assigning `uid` and `gid` values when packages add users and groups during package install time is to add them dynamically. This works fine for programs that do not care what the values of the resulting users and groups become. In these cases, the order of the installation determines the final `uid` and `gid` values. However, if non-deterministic `uid` and `gid` values are a problem, you can override the default, dynamic application of these values by setting static values. When you set static values, the OpenEmbedded build system looks in [`BBPATH`][4453] for `files/passwd` and `files/group` files for the values.

To use static `uid` and `gid` values, you need to set some variables. See the [`USERADDEXTENSION`][4454], [`USERADD_UID_TABLES`][4455], [`USERADD_GID_TABLES`][4456], and[`USERADD_ERROR_DYNAMIC`][4457] variables. You can also see the [`useradd`][4458] class for additional information.

### Notes

You do not use the `useradd-staticids` class directly. You either enable or disable the class by setting the `USERADDEXTENSION`variable. If you enable or disable the class in a configured system, [`TMPDIR`][4459] might contain incorrect `uid` and `gid` values. Deleting the `TMPDIR` directory will correct this condition.

### 8.147. `utility-tasks.bbclass`[¶][1354]

The `utility-tasks` class provides support for various "utility" type tasks that are applicable to all recipes, such as [`do_clean`][4460] and [`do_listtasks`][4461].

This class is enabled by default because it is inherited by the [`base`][4462] class.

### 8.148. `utils.bbclass`[¶][1355]

The `utils` class provides some useful Python functions that are typically used in inline Python expressions (e.g. `${@...}`). One example use is for `bb.utils.contains()`.

This class is enabled by default because it is inherited by the [`base`][4463] class.

### 8.149. `vala.bbclass`[¶][1356]

The `vala` class supports recipes that need to build software written using the Vala programming language.

### 8.150. `waf.bbclass`[¶][1357]

The `waf` class supports recipes that need to build software that uses the Waf build system. You can use the [`EXTRA_OECONF`][4464] or [`PACKAGECONFIG_CONFARGS`][4465]variables to specify additional configuration options to be passed on the Waf command line.

### Chapter 9. Tasks[¶][1982]


Tasks are units of execution for BitBake. Recipes (`.bb` files) use tasks to complete configuring, compiling, and packaging software. This chapter provides a reference of the tasks defined in the OpenEmbedded build system.

### 9.1. Normal Recipe Build Tasks[¶][1416]

The following sections describe normal tasks associated with building a recipe. For more information on tasks and dependencies, see the "[Tasks][4466]" and "[Dependencies][4467]" sections in the BitBake User Manual.

### 9.1.1. `do_build`[¶][637]

The default task for all recipes. This task depends on all other normal tasks required to build a recipe.

### 9.1.2. `do_compile`[¶][638]

Compiles the source code. This task runs with the current working directory set to `${`[`B`][4031]`}`.

The default behavior of this task is to run the `oe_runmake` function if a makefile (`Makefile`, `makefile`, or `GNUmakefile`) is found. If no such file is found, the `do_compile` task does nothing.

### 9.1.3. `do_compile_ptest_base`[¶][639]

Compiles the runtime test suite included in the software being built.

### 9.1.4. `do_configure`[¶][640]

Configures the source by enabling and disabling any build-time and configuration options for the software being built. The task runs with the current working directory set to `${`[`B`][4032]`}`.

The default behavior of this task is to run `oe_runmake clean` if a makefile (`Makefile`, `makefile`, or `GNUmakefile`) is found and [`CLEANBROKEN`][4033] is not set to "1". If no such file is found or the `CLEANBROKEN` variable is set to "1", the `do_configure` task does nothing.

### 9.1.5. `do_configure_ptest_base`[¶][641]

Configures the runtime test suite included in the software being built.

### 9.1.6. `do_deploy`[¶][642]

Writes output files that are to be deployed to `${`[`DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE`][4034]`}`. The task runs with the current working directory set to `${`[`B`][4035]`}`.

Recipes implementing this task should inherit the [`deploy`][4036] class and should write the output to `${`[`DEPLOYDIR`][4037]`}`, which is not to be confused with`${`[`DEPLOY_DIR`][4038]`}`. The `deploy` class sets up `do_deploy` as a shared state (sstate) task that can be accelerated through sstate use. The sstate mechanism takes care of copying the output from `${DEPLOYDIR}` to `${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}`.

### Caution

Do not write the output directly to `${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}`, as this causes the sstate mechanism to malfunction.

The `do_deploy` task is not added as a task by default and consequently needs to be added manually. If you want the task to run after [`do_compile`][4039], you can add it by doing the following:

```
     addtask deploy after do_compile

```

Adding `do_deploy` after other tasks works the same way.

### Note

You do not need to add `before do_build` to the `addtask` command (though it is harmless), because the [`base`][4040] class contains the following:
```
     do_build[recrdeptask] += "do_deploy"

```
See the "[Dependencies][4041]" section in the BitBake User Manual for more information.

If the `do_deploy` task re-executes, any previous output is removed (i.e. "cleaned").

### 9.1.7. `do_distrodata`[¶][643]

Provides information about the recipe.

The `distrodata` task is included as part of the [`distrodata`][4042] class.

To build the `distrodata` task, use the `bitbake` command with the "-c" option and task name:

```
     $ bitbake core-image-minimal -c distrodata

```

By default, the results are stored in [`$LOG_DIR`][4043] (e.g. `$BUILD_DIR/tmp/log`).

### 9.1.8. `do_fetch`[¶][644]

Fetches the source code. This task uses the [`SRC_URI`][4044] variable and the argument's prefix to determine the correct fetcher module.

### 9.1.9. `do_image`[¶][645]

Starts the image generation process. The `do_image` task runs after the OpenEmbedded build system has run the [`do_rootfs`][4045] task during which packages are identified for installation into the image and the root filesystem is created, complete with post-processing.

The `do_image` task performs pre-processing on the image through the [`IMAGE_PREPROCESS_COMMAND`][4046] and dynamically generates supporting `do_image_*`tasks as needed.

For more information on image creation, see the "[Image Generation][4047]" section.

### 9.1.10. `do_image_complete`[¶][646]

Completes the image generation process. The `do_image_complete` task runs after the OpenEmbedded build system has run the [`do_image`][4048] task during which image pre-processing occurs and through dynamically generated `do_image_*` tasks the image is constructed.

The `do_image_complete` task performs post-processing on the image through the [`IMAGE_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND`][4049].

For more information on image creation, see the "[Image Generation][4050]" section.

### 9.1.11. `do_install`[¶][647]

Copies files that are to be packaged into the holding area `${`[`D`][4051]`}`. This task runs with the current working directory set to `${`[`B`][4052]`}`, which is the compilation directory. The `do_install` task, as well as other tasks that either directly or indirectly depend on the installed files (e.g. [`do_package`][4053],[`do_package_write_*`][4054], and [`do_rootfs`][4055]), run under [fakeroot][4056].

### Caution

When installing files, be careful not to set the owner and group IDs of the installed files to unintended values. Some methods of copying files, notably when using the recursive `cp` command, can preserve the UID and/or GID of the original file, which is usually not what you want. The [`host-user-contaminated`][3686] QA check checks for files that probably have the wrong ownership.

Safe methods for installing files include the following:

*   The `install` utility. This utility is the preferred method.

*   The `cp` command with the "--no-preserve=ownership" option.

*   The `tar` command with the "--no-same-owner" option. See the `bin_package.bbclass` file in the `meta/classes` directory of the[Source Directory][648] for an example.

### 9.1.12. `do_install_ptest_base`[¶][649]

Copies the runtime test suite files from the compilation directory to a holding area.

### 9.1.13. `do_package`[¶][650]

Analyzes the content of the holding area `${`[`D`][4057]`}` and splits the content into subsets based on available packages and files. This task makes use of the[`PACKAGES`][4058] and [`FILES`][4059] variables.

The `do_package` task, in conjunction with the [`do_packagedata`][4060] task, also saves some important package metadata. For additional information, see the[`PKGDESTWORK`][4061] variable and the "[Automatically Added Runtime Dependencies][4062]" section.

### 9.1.14. `do_package_qa`[¶][651]

Runs QA checks on packaged files. For more information on these checks, see the [`insane`][4063] class.

### 9.1.15. `do_package_write_deb`[¶][652]

Creates Debian packages (i.e. `*.deb` files) and places them in the `${`[`DEPLOY_DIR_DEB`][4064]`}` directory in the package feeds area. For more information, see the "[Package Feeds][4065]" section.

### 9.1.16. `do_package_write_ipk`[¶][653]

Creates IPK packages (i.e. `*.ipk` files) and places them in the `${`[`DEPLOY_DIR_IPK`][4066]`}` directory in the package feeds area. For more information, see the "[Package Feeds][4067]" section.

### 9.1.17. `do_package_write_rpm`[¶][654]

Creates RPM packages (i.e. `*.rpm` files) and places them in the `${`[`DEPLOY_DIR_RPM`][4068]`}` directory in the package feeds area. For more information, see the "[Package Feeds][4069]" section.

### 9.1.18. `do_package_write_tar`[¶][655]

Creates tarballs and places them in the `${`[`DEPLOY_DIR_TAR`][4070]`}` directory in the package feeds area. For more information, see the "[Package Feeds][4071]" section.

### 9.1.19. `do_packagedata`[¶][656]

Saves package metadata generated by the [`do_package`][4072] task in [`PKGDATA_DIR`][4073] to make it available globally.

### 9.1.20. `do_patch`[¶][657]

Locates patch files and applies them to the source code. See the "[Patching][4074]" section for more information.

### 9.1.21. `do_populate_lic`[¶][658]

Writes license information for the recipe that is collected later when the image is constructed.

### 9.1.22. `do_populate_sdk`[¶][659]

Creates the file and directory structure for an installable SDK. See the "[SDK Generation][4075]" section for more information.

### 9.1.23. `do_populate_sysroot`[¶][660]

Stages (copies) a subset of the files installed by the [`do_install`][4076] task into the appropriate sysroot. For information on how to access these files from other recipes, see the [`STAGING_DIR*`][4077] variables. Directories that would typically not be needed by other recipes at build time (e.g. `/etc`) are not copied by default.

For information on what directories are copied by default, see the [`SYSROOT_DIRS*`][4078] variables. You can change these variables inside your recipe if you need to make additional (or fewer) directories available to other recipes at build time.

The `do_populate_sysroot` task is a shared state (sstate) task, which means that the task can be accelerated through sstate use. Realize also that if the task is re-executed, any previous output is removed (i.e. "cleaned").

### 9.1.24. `do_prepare_recipe_sysroot`[¶][661]

Installs the files into the individual recipe work directories (i.e. WORKDIR). See the "[`staging`][4079]" class for more information.

### 9.1.25. `do_rm_work`[¶][662]

Removes work files after the OpenEmbedded build system has finished with them. You can learn more by looking at the "[`rm_work.bbclass`][4080]" section.

### 9.1.26. `do_rm_work_all`[¶][663]

Top-level task for removing work files after the build system has finished with them.

### 9.1.27. `do_unpack`[¶][664]

Unpacks the source code into a working directory pointed to by `${`[`WORKDIR`][4081]`}`. The [`S`][4082] variable also plays a role in where unpacked source files ultimately reside. For more information on how source files are unpacked, see the "[Source Fetching][4083]" section and the `WORKDIR` and `S` variable descriptions.

### 9.2. Manually Called Tasks[¶][1417]

These tasks are typically manually triggered (e.g. by using the `bitbake -c` command-line option):

### 9.2.1. `do_checkpkg`[¶][665]

Provides information about the recipe including its upstream version and status. The upstream version and status reveals whether or not a version of the recipe exists upstream and a status of not updated, updated, or unknown.

The `checkpkg` task is included as part of the [`distrodata`][4084] class.

To build the `checkpkg` task, use the `bitbake` command with the "-c" option and task name:

```
     $ bitbake core-image-minimal -c checkpkg

```

By default, the results are stored in [`$LOG_DIR`][4085] (e.g. `$BUILD_DIR/tmp/log`).

### 9.2.2. `do_checkuri`[¶][666]

Validates the [`SRC_URI`][4086] value.

### 9.2.3. `do_checkuriall`[¶][667]

Validates the [`SRC_URI`][4087] value for all recipes required to build a target.

### 9.2.4. `do_clean`[¶][668]

Removes all output files for a target from the [`do_unpack`][4088] task forward (i.e. [`do_unpack`][4089], [`do_configure`][4090], [`do_compile`][4091], [`do_install`][4092], and [`do_package`][4093]).

You can run this task using BitBake as follows:

```
     $ bitbake -c clean recipe

```

Running this task does not remove the [sstate][4094]) cache files. Consequently, if no changes have been made and the recipe is rebuilt after cleaning, output files are simply restored from the sstate cache. If you want to remove the sstate cache files for the recipe, you need to use the [`do_cleansstate`][4095] task instead (i.e. `bitbake -c cleansstate`  _`recipe`_ ).

### 9.2.5. `do_cleanall`[¶][669]

Removes all output files, shared state ([sstate][4096]) cache, and downloaded source files for a target (i.e. the contents of [`DL_DIR`][4097]). Essentially, the `do_cleanall` task is identical to the [`do_cleansstate`][4098] task with the added removal of downloaded source files.

You can run this task using BitBake as follows:

```
     $ bitbake -c cleanall recipe

```

Typically, you would not normally use the `cleanall` task. Do so only if you want to start fresh with the [`do_fetch`][4099] task.

### 9.2.6. `do_cleansstate`[¶][670]

Removes all output files and shared state ([sstate][4100]) cache for a target. Essentially, the `do_cleansstate` task is identical to the [`do_clean`][4101] task with the added removal of shared state ([sstate][4102]) cache.

You can run this task using BitBake as follows:

```
     $ bitbake -c cleansstate recipe

```

When you run the `do_cleansstate` task, the OpenEmbedded build system no longer uses any sstate. Consequently, building the recipe from scratch is guaranteed.

### Note

The `do_cleansstate` task cannot remove sstate from a remote sstate mirror. If you need to build a target from scratch using remote mirrors, use the "-f" option as follows:
```
     $ bitbake -f -c do_cleansstate target

```

### 9.2.7. `do_devpyshell`[¶][671]

Starts a shell in which an interactive Python interpreter allows you to interact with the BitBake build environment. From within this shell, you can directly examine and set bits from the data store and execute functions as if within the BitBake environment. See the "[Using a Development Python Shell][4103]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual for more information about using `devpyshell`.

### 9.2.8. `do_devshell`[¶][672]

Starts a shell whose environment is set up for development, debugging, or both. See the "[Using a Development Shell][4104]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual for more information about using `devshell`.

### 9.2.9. `do_fetchall`[¶][673]

Fetches all remote sources required to build a target.

### 9.2.10. `do_listtasks`[¶][674]

Lists all defined tasks for a target.

### 9.2.11. `do_package_index`[¶][675]

Creates or updates the index in the [Package Feeds][4105] area.

### Note

This task is not triggered with the `bitbake -c` command-line option as are the other tasks in this section. Because this task is specifically for the `package-index` recipe, you run it using `bitbake package-index`.

### 9.3. Image-Related Tasks[¶][1418]

The following tasks are applicable to image recipes.

### 9.3.1. `do_bootimg`[¶][676]

Creates a bootable live image. See the [`IMAGE_FSTYPES`][4106] variable for additional information on live image types.

### 9.3.2. `do_bundle_initramfs`[¶][677]

Combines an initial RAM disk (initramfs) image and kernel together to form a single image. The [`CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE`][4107] variable has some more information about these types of images.

### 9.3.3. `do_rootfs`[¶][678]

Creates the root filesystem (file and directory structure) for an image. See the "[Image Generation][4108]" section for more information on how the root filesystem is created.

### 9.3.4. `do_testimage`[¶][679]

Boots an image and performs runtime tests within the image. For information on automatically testing images, see the "[Performing Automated Runtime Testing][4109]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

### 9.3.5. `do_testimage_auto`[¶][680]

Boots an image and performs runtime tests within the image immediately after it has been built. This task is enabled when you set [`TEST_IMAGE`][4110] equal to "1".

For information on automatically testing images, see the "[Performing Automated Runtime Testing][4111]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

### 9.3.6. `do_vmdkimg`[¶][681]

Creates a `.vmdk` image for use with [VMware][4112] and compatible virtual machine hosts.

### 9.4. Kernel-Related Tasks[¶][1419]

The following tasks are applicable to kernel recipes. Some of these tasks (e.g. the [`do_menuconfig`][4468] task) are also applicable to recipes that use Linux kernel style configuration such as the BusyBox recipe.

### 9.4.1. `do_compile_kernelmodules`[¶][682]

Runs the step that builds the kernel modules (if needed). Building a kernel consists of two steps: 1) the kernel (`vmlinux`) is built, and 2) the modules are built (i.e. `make modules`).

### 9.4.2. `do_diffconfig`[¶][683]

When invoked by the user, this task creates a file containing the differences between the original config as produced by [`do_kernel_configme`][4113] task and the changes made by the user with other methods (i.e. using ([`do_kernel_menuconfig`][4114]). Once the file of differences is created, it can be used to create a config fragment that only contains the differences. You can invoke this task from the command line as follows:

```
     $ bitbake linux-yocto -c diffconfig

```

For more information, see the "[Generating Configuration Files][4115]" section in the Yocto Project Linux Kernel Development Manual.

### 9.4.3. `do_kernel_checkout`[¶][684]

Converts the newly unpacked kernel source into a form with which the OpenEmbedded build system can work. Because the kernel source can be fetched in several different ways, the `do_kernel_checkout` task makes sure that subsequent tasks are given a clean working tree copy of the kernel with the correct branches checked out.

### 9.4.4. `do_kernel_configcheck`[¶][685]

Validates the configuration produced by the [`do_kernel_menuconfig`][4116] task. The `do_kernel_configcheck` task produces warnings when a requested configuration does not appear in the final `.config` file or when you override a policy configuration in a hardware configuration fragment. You can run this task explicitly and view the output by using the following command:

```
     $ bitbake linux-yocto -c kernel_configcheck -f

```

For more information, see the "[Generating Configuration Files][4117]" section in the Yocto Project Linux Kernel Development Manual.

### 9.4.5. `do_kernel_configme`[¶][686]

After the kernel is patched by the [`do_patch`][4118] task, the `do_kernel_configme` task assembles and merges all the kernel config fragments into a merged configuration that can then be passed to the kernel configuration phase proper. This is also the time during which user-specified defconfigs are applied if present, and where configuration modes such as `--allnoconfig` are applied.

### 9.4.6. `do_kernel_menuconfig`[¶][687]

Invoked by the user to manipulate the `.config` file used to build a linux-yocto recipe. This task starts the Linux kernel configuration tool, which you then use to modify the kernel configuration.

### Note

You can also invoke this tool from the command line as follows:
```
     $ bitbake linux-yocto -c menuconfig

```

See the "[Generating Configuration Files][4119]" section in the Yocto Project Linux Kernel Development Manual for more information on this configuration tool. You can also reference the "[Using `menuconfig`][4120]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

### 9.4.7. `do_kernel_metadata`[¶][688]

Collects all the features required for a given kernel build, whether the features come from [`SRC_URI`][4121] or from Git repositories. After collection, the `do_kernel_metadata` task processes the features into a series of config fragments and patches, which can then be applied by subsequent tasks such as [`do_patch`][4122] and [`do_kernel_configme`][4123].

### 9.4.8. `do_menuconfig`[¶][689]

Runs `make menuconfig` for the kernel. For information on `menuconfig`, see the "[Using  `menuconfig`][4124]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

### 9.4.9. `do_savedefconfig`[¶][690]

When invoked by the user, creates a defconfig file that can be used instead of the default defconfig. The saved defconfig contains the differences between the default defconfig and the changes made by the user using other methods (i.e. the [`do_kernel_menuconfig`][4125] task. You can invoke the task using the following command:

```
     $ bitbake linux-yocto -c savedefconfig

```

### 9.4.10. `do_shared_workdir`[¶][691]

After the kernel has been compiled but before the kernel modules have been compiled, this task copies files required for module builds and which are generated from the kernel build into the shared work directory. With these copies successfully copied, the [`do_compile_kernelmodules`][4126] task can successfully build the kernel modules in the next step of the build.

### 9.4.11. `do_sizecheck`[¶][692]

After the kernel has been built, this task checks the size of the stripped kernel image against [`KERNEL_IMAGE_MAXSIZE`][4127]. If that variable was set and the size of the stripped kernel exceeds that size, the kernel build produces a warning to that effect.

### 9.4.12. `do_strip`[¶][693]

If `KERNEL_IMAGE_STRIP_EXTRA_SECTIONS` is defined, this task strips the sections named in that variable from `vmlinux`. This stripping is typically used to remove nonessential sections such as `.comment` sections from a size-sensitive configuration.

### 9.4.13. `do_validate_branches`[¶][694]

After the kernel is unpacked but before it is patched, this task makes sure that the machine and metadata branches as specified by the [`SRCREV`][4128]variables actually exist on the specified branches. If these branches do not exist and [`AUTOREV`][4129] is not being used, the `do_validate_branches` task fails during the build.

### 9.5. Miscellaneous Tasks[¶][1420]

The following sections describe miscellaneous tasks.

### 9.5.1. `do_spdx`[¶][695]

A build stage that takes the source code and scans it on a remote FOSSOLOGY server in order to produce an SPDX document. This task applies only to the [`spdx`][4130] class.

The `devtool` command-line tool provides a number of features that help you build, test, and package software. This command is available alongside the `bitbake` command. Additionally, the `devtool` command is a key part of the extensible SDK.

This chapter provides a Quick Reference for the `devtool` command. For more information on how to apply the command when using the extensible SDK, see the "[Using the Extensible SDK][4533]" section in the Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK) Developer's Guide.

### 10.1. Getting Help[¶][1421]

     Use devtool <subcommand> --help to get help on a specific command

```

As directed in the general help output, you can get more syntax on a specific command by providing the command name and using `--help`:

```
     $ devtool add --help
     usage: devtool add [-h] [--same-dir | --no-same-dir] [--fetch URI]
                        [--version VERSION] [--no-git] [--autorev] [--binary]

     optionally fetch a remote URI and unpack it to create the source tree.

     arguments:
       recipename            Name for new recipe to add (just name - no version,
                             path or extension). If not specified, will attempt to
                             auto-detect it.

```

### 10.2. The Workspace Layer Structure[¶][1422]

`devtool` uses a "Workspace" layer in which to accomplish builds. This layer is not specific to any single `devtool` command but is rather a common working area used across the tool.

The following figure shows the workspace structure:

| 
![](https://www.yoctoproject.org/docs/current/ref-manual/figures/build-workspace-directory.png)
 |

```
     attic - A directory created if devtool believes it preserve
             anything when you run "devtool reset".  For example, if you
             run "devtool add", make changes to the recipe, and then
             run "devtool reset", devtool takes notice that the file has
             been changed and moves it into the attic should you still
             want the recipe.

     README - Provides information on what is in workspace layer and how to
              manage it.

     .devtool_md5 - A checksum file used by devtool.

     appends - A directory that contains *.bbappend files, which point to
               external source.

     conf - A configuration directory that contains the layer.conf file.

     recipes - A directory containing recipes.  This directory contains a
               folder for each directory added whose name matches that of the
               added recipe.  devtool places the recipe.bb file
               within that sub-directory.

     sources - A directory containing a working copy of the source files used
               when building the recipe.  This is the default directory used
               as the location of the source tree when you do not provide a
               source tree path.  This directory contains a folder for each
               set of source files matched to a corresponding recipe.

```

### 10.3. Adding a New Recipe to the Workspace Layer[¶][1423]

Use the `devtool add` command to add a new recipe to the workspace layer. The recipe you add should not exist - `devtool` creates it for you. The source files the recipe uses should exist in an external area.

The following example creates and adds a new recipe named `jackson` to a workspace layer the tool creates. The source code built by the recipes resides in `/home/scottrif/sources/jackson`:

```
     $ devtool add jackson /home/scottrif/sources/jackson

```

If you add a recipe and the workspace layer does not exist, the command creates the layer and populates it as described in "[The Workspace Layer Structure][4469]" section.

Running `devtool add` when the workspace layer exists causes the tool to add the recipe, append files, and source files into the existing workspace layer. The `.bbappend` file is created to point to the external source tree.

### Note

If your recipe has runtime dependencies defined, you must be sure that these packages exist on the target hardware before attempting to run your application. If dependent packages (e.g. libraries) do not exist on the target, your application, when run, will fail to find those functions. For more information, see the "[Deploying Your Software on the Target Machine][4470]" section.

### 10.4. Extracting the Source for an Existing Recipe[¶][1424]

Use the `devtool extract` command to extract the source for an existing recipe. When you use this command, you must supply the root name of the recipe (i.e. no version, paths, or extensions), and you must supply the directory to which you want the source extracted.

Additional command options let you control the name of a development branch into which you can checkout the source and whether or not to keep a temporary directory, which is useful for debugging.

### 10.5. Synchronizing a Recipe's Extracted Source Tree[¶][1425]

Use the `devtool sync` command to synchronize a previously extracted source tree for an existing recipe. When you use this command, you must supply the root name of the recipe (i.e. no version, paths, or extensions), and you must supply the directory to which you want the source extracted.

Additional command options let you control the name of a development branch into which you can checkout the source and whether or not to keep a temporary directory, which is useful for debugging.

### 10.6. Modifying an Existing Recipe[¶][1426]

Use the `devtool modify` command to begin modifying the source of an existing recipe. This command is very similar to the [`add`][4471] command except that it does not physically create the recipe in the workspace layer because the recipe already exists in an another layer.

The `devtool modify` command extracts the source for a recipe, sets it up as a Git repository if the source had not already been fetched from Git, checks out a branch for development, and applies any patches from the recipe as commits on top. You can use the following command to checkout the source files:

```
     $ devtool modify recipe

```

Using the above command form, `devtool` uses the existing recipe's [`SRC_URI`][4472] statement to locate the upstream source, extracts the source into the default sources location in the workspace. The default development branch used is "devtool".

### 10.7. Edit an Existing Recipe[¶][1427]

Use the `devtool edit-recipe` command to run the default editor, which is identified using the `EDITOR` variable, on the specified recipe.

When you use the `devtool edit-recipe` command, you must supply the root name of the recipe (i.e. no version, paths, or extensions). Also, the recipe file itself must reside in the workspace as a result of the `devtool add` or `devtool upgrade` commands. However, you can override that requirement by using the "-a" or "--any-recipe" option. Using either of these options allows you to edit any recipe regardless of its location.

### 10.8. Updating a Recipe[¶][1428]

Use the `devtool update-recipe` command to update your recipe with patches that reflect changes you make to the source files. For example, if you know you are going to work on some code, you could first use the [`devtool modify`][4473] command to extract the code and set up the workspace. After which, you could modify, compile, and test the code.

When you are satisfied with the results and you have committed your changes to the Git repository, you can then run the `devtool update-recipe` to create the patches and update the recipe:

```
     $ devtool update-recipe recipe

```

If you run the `devtool update-recipe` without committing your changes, the command ignores the changes.

Often, you might want to apply customizations made to your software in your own layer rather than apply them to the original recipe. If so, you can use the `-a` or `--append` option with the `devtool update-recipe` command. These options allow you to specify the layer into which to write an append file:

```
     $ devtool update-recipe recipe -a base-layer-directory

```

The `*.bbappend` file is created at the appropriate path within the specified layer directory, which may or may not be in your `bblayers.conf` file. If an append file already exists, the command updates it appropriately.

### 10.9. Upgrading a Recipe[¶][1429]

Use the `devtool upgrade` command to upgrade an existing recipe to a new upstream version. The command puts the upgraded recipe file into the workspace along with any associated files, and extracts the source tree to a specified location should patches need rebased or added to as a result of the upgrade.

When you use the `devtool upgrade` command, you must supply the root name of the recipe (i.e. no version, paths, or extensions), and you must supply the directory to which you want the source extracted. Additional command options let you control things such as the version number to which you want to upgrade (i.e. the [`PV`][4474]), the source revision to which you want to upgrade (i.e. the [`SRCREV`][4475], whether or not to apply patches, and so forth.

### 10.10. Resetting a Recipe[¶][1430]

Use the `devtool reset` command to remove a recipe and its configuration (e.g. the corresponding `.bbappend` file) from the workspace layer. Realize that this command deletes the recipe and the append file. The command does not physically move them for you. Consequently, you must be sure to physically relocate your updated recipe and the append file outside of the workspace layer before running the `devtool reset` command.

If the `devtool reset` command detects that the recipe or the append files have been modified, the command preserves the modified files in a separate "attic" subdirectory under the workspace layer.

Here is an example that resets the workspace directory that contains the `mtr` recipe:

```
     $ devtool reset mtr
     NOTE: Cleaning sysroot for recipe mtr...
     NOTE: Leaving source tree /home/scottrif/poky/build/workspace/sources/mtr as-is; if you no
        longer need it then please delete it manually
     $

```

### 10.11. Building Your Recipe[¶][1431]

Use the `devtool build` command to cause the OpenEmbedded build system to build your recipe. The `devtool build` command is equivalent to`bitbake -c populate_sysroot`.

When you use the `devtool build` command, you must supply the root name of the recipe (i.e. no version, paths, or extensions). You can use either the "-s" or the "--disable-parallel-make" option to disable parallel makes during the build. Here is an example:

```
     $ devtool build recipe

```

### 10.12. Building Your Image[¶][1432]

Use the `devtool build-image` command to build an image, extending it to include packages from recipes in the workspace. Using this command is useful when you want an image that ready for immediate deployment onto a device for testing. For proper integration into a final image, you need to edit your custom image recipe appropriately.

When you use the `devtool build-image` command, you must supply the name of the image. This command has no command line options:

```
     $ devtool build-image image

```

### 10.13. Deploying Your Software on the Target Machine[¶][1433]

Use the `devtool deploy-target` command to deploy the recipe's build output to the live target machine:

```
     $ devtool deploy-target recipe target

```

The  _`target`_  is the address of the target machine, which must be running an SSH server (i.e. `user@hostname[:destdir]`).

This command deploys all files installed during the [`do_install`][4476] task. Furthermore, you do not need to have package management enabled within the target machine. If you do, the package manager is bypassed.

### Notes

The `deploy-target` functionality is for development only. You should never use it to update an image that will be used in production.

Some conditions exist that could prevent a deployed application from behaving as expected. When both of the following conditions exist, your application has the potential to not behave correctly when run on the target:

*   You are deploying a new application to the target and the recipe you used to build the application had correctly defined runtime dependencies.

*   The target does not physically have the packages on which the application depends installed.

If both of these conditions exist, your application will not behave as expected. The reason for this misbehavior is because the `devtool deploy-target`command does not deploy the packages (e.g. libraries) on which your new application depends. The assumption is that the packages are already on the target. Consequently, when a runtime call is made in the application for a dependent function (e.g. a library call), the function cannot be found.

To be sure you have all the dependencies local to the target, you need to be sure that the packages are pre-deployed (installed) on the target before attempting to run your application.

### 10.14. Removing Your Software from the Target Machine[¶][1434]

Use the `devtool undeploy-target` command to remove deployed build output from the target machine. For the `devtool undeploy-target` command to work, you must have previously used the [`devtool deploy-target`][4477] command.

```
     $ devtool undeploy-target recipe target

```

The  _`target`_  is the address of the target machine, which must be running an SSH server (i.e. `user@hostname`).

### 10.15. Creating the Workspace Layer in an Alternative Location[¶][1435]

Use the `devtool create-workspace` command to create a new workspace layer in your [Build Directory][4478]. When you create a new workspace layer, it is populated with the `README` file and the `conf` directory only.

The following example creates a new workspace layer in your current working and by default names the workspace layer "workspace":

```
     $ devtool create-workspace

```

You can create a workspace layer anywhere by supplying a pathname with the command. The following command creates a new workspace layer named "new-workspace":

```
     $ devtool create-workspace /home/scottrif/new-workspace

```

### 10.16. Get the Status of the Recipes in Your Workspace[¶][1436]

Use the `devtool status` command to list the recipes currently in your workspace. Information includes the paths to their respective external source trees.

The `devtool status` command has no command-line options:

```
     $ devtool status

```

Following is sample output after using [`devtool add`][4479] to create and add the `mtr_0.86.bb` recipe to the `workspace` directory:

```
     $ devtool status
     mtr: /home/scottrif/poky/build/workspace/sources/mtr (/home/scottrif/poky/build/workspace/recipes/mtr/mtr_0.86.bb)
     $

```

### 10.17. Search for Available Target Recipes[¶][1437]

Use the `devtool search` command to search for available target recipes. The command matches the recipe name, package name, description, and installed files. The command displays the recipe name as a result of a match.

When you use the `devtool search` command, you must supply a  _`keyword`_ . The command uses the  _`keyword`_  when searching for a match.

</dl>

### 11.1. Introduction[¶][1438]

When building a recipe, the OpenEmbedded build system performs various QA checks on the output to ensure that common issues are detected and reported. Sometimes when you create a new recipe to build new software, it will build with no problems. When this is not the case, or when you have QA issues building any software, it could take a little time to resolve them.

While it is tempting to ignore a QA message or even to disable QA checks, it is best to try and resolve any reported QA issues. This chapter provides a list of the QA messages and brief explanations of the issues you could encounter so that you can properly resolve problems.

The next section provides a list of all QA error and warning messages based on a default configuration. Each entry provides the message or error form along with an explanation.

### Notes

*   At the end of each message, the name of the associated QA test (as listed in the "[`insane.bbclass`][1439]" section) appears within square brackets.

*   As mentioned, this list of error and warning messages is for QA checks only. The list does not cover all possible build errors or warnings you could encounter.

*   Because some QA checks are disabled by default, this list does not include all possible QA check errors and warnings.

### 11.2. Errors and Warnings[¶][1440]

*   `<packagename>: <path> is using libexec please relocate to <libexecdir> [libexec] `[¶][1441]

    The specified package contains files in `/usr/libexec` when the distro configuration uses a different path for `<libexecdir>` By default, `<libexecdir>` is `$prefix/libexec`. However, this default can be changed (e.g. `${libdir}`).

*   `package <packagename> contains bad RPATH <rpath> in file <file> [rpaths] `[¶][1442]

    The specified binary produced by the recipe contains dynamic library load paths (rpaths) that contain build system paths such as [`TMPDIR`][1985], which are incorrect for the target and could potentially be a security issue. Check for bad `-rpath` options being passed to the linker in your [`do_compile`][1986] log. Depending on the build system used by the software being built, there might be a configure option to disable rpath usage completely within the build of the software.

*   `<packagename>: <file> contains probably-redundant RPATH <rpath> [useless-rpaths] `[¶][1443]

    The specified binary produced by the recipe contains dynamic library load paths (rpaths) that on a standard system are searched by default by the linker (e.g. `/lib` and `/usr/lib`). While these paths will not cause any breakage, they do waste space and are unnecessary. Depending on the build system used by the software being built, there might be a configure option to disable rpath usage completely within the build of the software.

*   `<packagename> requires <files>, but no providers in its RDEPENDS [file-rdeps] `[¶][1444]

    A file-level dependency has been identified from the specified package on the specified files, but there is no explicit corresponding entry in[`RDEPENDS`][1987]. If particular files are required at runtime then `RDEPENDS` should be declared in the recipe to ensure the packages providing them are built.

*   `<packagename1> rdepends on <packagename2>, but it isn't a build dependency? [build-deps] `[¶][1445]

    A runtime dependency exists between the two specified packages, but there is nothing explicit within the recipe to enable the OpenEmbedded build system to ensure that dependency is satisfied. This condition is usually triggered by an [`RDEPENDS`][1988] value being added at the packaging stage rather than up front, which is usually automatic based on the contents of the package. In most cases, you should change the recipe to add an explicit `RDEPENDS` for the dependency.

*   `non -dev/-dbg/nativesdk- package contains symlink .so: <packagename> path '<path>' [dev-so] `[¶][1446]

    Symlink `.so` files are for development only, and should therefore go into the `-dev` package. This situation might occur if you add `*.so*` rather than`*.so.*` to a non-dev package. Change [`FILES`][1989] (and possibly [`PACKAGES`][1990]) such that the specified `.so` file goes into an appropriate `-dev` package.

*   `non -staticdev package contains static .a library: <packagename> path '<path>' [staticdev] `[¶][1447]

    Static `.a` library files should go into a `-staticdev` package. Change [`FILES`][1991] (and possibly [`PACKAGES`][1992]) such that the specified `.a` file goes into an appropriate `-staticdev` package.

*   `<packagename>: found library in wrong location [libdir] `[¶][1448]

    The specified file may have been installed into an incorrect (possibly hardcoded) installation path. For example, this test will catch recipes that install `/lib/bar.so` when `${base_libdir}` is "lib32". Another example is when recipes install `/usr/lib64/foo.so` when `${libdir}` is "/usr/lib". False positives occasionally exist. For these cases add "libdir" to [`INSANE_SKIP`][1993] for the package.

*   `non debug package contains .debug directory: <packagename> path <path> [debug-files] `[¶][1449]

    The specified package contains a `.debug` directory, which should not appear in anything but the `-dbg` package. This situation might occur if you add a path which contains a `.debug` directory and do not explicitly add the `.debug` directory to the `-dbg` package. If this is the case, add the `.debug`directory explicitly to `FILES_${PN}-dbg`. See [`FILES`][1994] for additional information on `FILES`.

*   `Architecture did not match (<machine_arch> to <file_arch>) on <file> [arch] `[¶][1450]

    By default, the OpenEmbedded build system checks the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) type, bit size, and endianness of any binaries to ensure they match the target architecture. This test fails if any binaries do not match the type since there would be an incompatibility. The test could indicate that the wrong compiler or compiler options have been used. Sometimes software, like bootloaders, might need to bypass this check. If the file you receive the error for is firmware that is not intended to be executed within the target operating system or is intended to run on a separate processor within the device, you can add "arch" to [`INSANE_SKIP`][1995] for the package. Another option is to check the [`do_compile`][1996] log and verify that the compiler options being used are correct.

*   `Bit size did not match (<machine_bits> to <file_bits>) <recipe> on <file> [arch] `[¶][1451]

    By default, the OpenEmbedded build system checks the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) type, bit size, and endianness of any binaries to ensure they match the target architecture. This test fails if any binaries do not match the type since there would be an incompatibility. The test could indicate that the wrong compiler or compiler options have been used. Sometimes software, like bootloaders, might need to bypass this check. If the file you receive the error for is firmware that is not intended to be executed within the target operating system or is intended to run on a separate processor within the device, you can add "arch" to [`INSANE_SKIP`][1997] for the package. Another option is to check the [`do_compile`][1998] log and verify that the compiler options being used are correct.

*   `Endianness did not match (<machine_endianness> to <file_endianness>) on <file> [arch] `[¶][1452]

    By default, the OpenEmbedded build system checks the Executable and Linkable Format (ELF) type, bit size, and endianness of any binaries to ensure they match the target architecture. This test fails if any binaries do not match the type since there would be an incompatibility. The test could indicate that the wrong compiler or compiler options have been used. Sometimes software, like bootloaders, might need to bypass this check. If the file you receive the error for is firmware that is not intended to be executed within the target operating system or is intended to run on a separate processor within the device, you can add "arch" to [`INSANE_SKIP`][1999] for the package. Another option is to check the [`do_compile`][2000] log and verify that the compiler options being used are correct.

*   `ELF binary '<file>' has relocations in .text [textrel] `[¶][1453]

    The specified ELF binary contains relocations in its `.text` sections. This situation can result in a performance impact at runtime.

    Typically, the way to solve this performance issue is to add "-fPIC" or "-fpic" to the compiler command-line options. For example, given software that reads [`CFLAGS`][2001] when you build it, you could add the following to your recipe:

    ```
         CFLAGS_append = " -fPIC "

    ```

    For more information on text relocations at runtime, see [http://www.akkadia.org/drepper/textrelocs.html][2002].

*   `No GNU_HASH in the elf binary: '<file>' [ldflags] `[¶][1454]

    This indicates that binaries produced when building the recipe have not been linked with the [`LDFLAGS`][2003] options provided by the build system. Check to be sure that the `LDFLAGS` variable is being passed to the linker command. A common workaround for this situation is to pass in `LDFLAGS` using[`TARGET_CC_ARCH`][2004] within the recipe as follows:

    ```
         TARGET_CC_ARCH += "${LDFLAGS}"

    ```

*   `Package <packagename> contains Xorg driver (<driver>) but no xorg-abi- dependencies [xorg-driver-abi] `[¶][1455]

    The specified package contains an Xorg driver, but does not have a corresponding ABI package dependency. The xserver-xorg recipe provides driver ABI names. All drivers should depend on the ABI versions that they have been built against. Driver recipes that include `xorg-driver-input.inc` or`xorg-driver-video.inc` will automatically get these versions. Consequently, you should only need to explicitly add dependencies to binary driver recipes.

*   `The /usr/share/info/dir file is not meant to be shipped in a particular package. [infodir] `[¶][1456]

    The `/usr/share/info/dir` should not be packaged. Add the following line to your [`do_install`][2005] task or to your `do_install_append` within the recipe as follows:

    ```
         rm ${D}${infodir}/dir

    ```

*   `Symlink <path> in <packagename> points to TMPDIR [symlink-to-sysroot] `[¶][1457]

    The specified symlink points into [`TMPDIR`][2006] on the host. Such symlinks will work on the host. However, they are clearly invalid when running on the target. You should either correct the symlink to use a relative path or remove the symlink.

*   `<file> failed sanity test (workdir) in path <path> [la] `[¶][1458]

    The specified `.la` file contains [`TMPDIR`][2007] paths. Any `.la` file containing these paths is incorrect since `libtool` adds the correct sysroot prefix when using the files automatically itself.

*   `<file> failed sanity test (tmpdir) in path <path> [pkgconfig] `[¶][1459]

    The specified `.pc` file contains [`TMPDIR`][2008]`/`[`WORKDIR`][2009] paths. Any `.pc` file containing these paths is incorrect since `pkg-config` itself adds the correct sysroot prefix when the files are accessed.

*   `<packagename> rdepends on <debug_packagename> [debug-deps] `[¶][1460]

    A dependency exists between the specified non-dbg package (i.e. a package whose name does not end in `-dbg`) and a package that is a `dbg`package. The `dbg` packages contain debug symbols and are brought in using several different methods:

    *   Using the `dbg-pkgs` [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][63] value.

    *   Using [`IMAGE_INSTALL`][64].

    *   As a dependency of another `dbg` package that was brought in using one of the above methods.

    The dependency might have been automatically added because the `dbg` package erroneously contains files that it should not contain (e.g. a non-symlink `.so` file) or it might have been added manually (e.g. by adding to [`RDEPENDS`][2010]).

*   `<packagename> rdepends on <dev_packagename> [dev-deps] `[¶][1461]

    A dependency exists between the specified non-dev package (a package whose name does not end in `-dev`) and a package that is a `dev` package. The `dev` packages contain development headers and are usually brought in using several different methods:

    *   Using the `dev-pkgs` [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][65] value.

    *   Using [`IMAGE_INSTALL`][66].

    *   As a dependency of another `dev` package that was brought in using one of the above methods.

    The dependency might have been automatically added (because the `dev` package erroneously contains files that it should not have (e.g. a non-symlink `.so` file) or it might have been added manually (e.g. by adding to [`RDEPENDS`][2011]).

*   `<var>_<packagename> is invalid: <comparison> (<value>) only comparisons <, =, >, <=, and >= are allowed [dep-cmp] `[¶][1462]

    If you are adding a versioned dependency relationship to one of the dependency variables ([`RDEPENDS`][2012], [`RRECOMMENDS`][2013], [`RSUGGESTS`][2014], [`RPROVIDES`][2015],[`RREPLACES`][2016], or [`RCONFLICTS`][2017]), you must only use the named comparison operators. Change the versioned dependency values you are adding to match those listed in the message.

*   `<recipename>: The compile log indicates that host include and/or library paths were used. Please check the log '<logfile>' for more information. [compile-host-path] `[¶][1463]

    The log for the [`do_compile`][2018] task indicates that paths on the host were searched for files, which is not appropriate when cross-compiling. Look for "is unsafe for cross-compilation" or "CROSS COMPILE Badness" in the specified log file.

*   `<recipename>: The install log indicates that host include and/or library paths were used. Please check the log '<logfile>' for more information. [install-host-path] `[¶][1464]

    The log for the [`do_install`][2019] task indicates that paths on the host were searched for files, which is not appropriate when cross-compiling. Look for "is unsafe for cross-compilation" or "CROSS COMPILE Badness" in the specified log file.

*   `This autoconf log indicates errors, it looked at host include and/or library paths while determining system capabilities. Rerun configure task after fixing this. The path was '<path>' `[¶][1465]

    The log for the [`do_configure`][2020] task indicates that paths on the host were searched for files, which is not appropriate when cross-compiling. Look for "is unsafe for cross-compilation" or "CROSS COMPILE Badness" in the specified log file.

*   `<packagename> doesn't match the [a-z0-9.+-]+ regex [pkgname] `[¶][1466]

    The convention within the OpenEmbedded build system (sometimes enforced by the package manager itself) is to require that package names are all lower case and to allow a restricted set of characters. If your recipe name does not match this, or you add packages to [`PACKAGES`][2021] that do not conform to the convention, then you will receive this error. Rename your recipe. Or, if you have added a non-conforming package name to`PACKAGES`, change the package name appropriately.

*   `<recipe>: configure was passed unrecognized options: <options> [unknown-configure-option] `[¶][1467]

    The configure script is reporting that the specified options are unrecognized. This situation could be because the options were previously valid but have been removed from the configure script. Or, there was a mistake when the options were added and there is another option that should be used instead. If you are unsure, consult the upstream build documentation, the `./configure --help` output, and the upstream change log or release notes. Once you have worked out what the appropriate change is, you can update [`EXTRA_OECONF`][2022], [`PACKAGECONFIG_CONFARGS`][2023], or the individual [`PACKAGECONFIG`][2024] option values accordingly.

*   `Recipe <recipefile> has PN of "<recipename>" which is in OVERRIDES, this can result in unexpected behavior. [pn-overrides] `[¶][1468]

    The specified recipe has a name ([`PN`][2025]) value that appears in [`OVERRIDES`][2026]. If a recipe is named such that its `PN` value matches something already in`OVERRIDES` (e.g. `PN` happens to be the same as [`MACHINE`][2027] or [`DISTRO`][2028]), it can have unexpected consequences. For example, assignments such as`FILES_${PN} = "xyz"` effectively turn into `FILES = "xyz"`. Rename your recipe (or if `PN` is being set explicitly, change the `PN` value) so that the conflict does not occur. See [`FILES`][2029] for additional information.

*   `<recipefile>: Variable <variable> is set as not being package specific, please fix this. [pkgvarcheck] `[¶][1469]

    Certain variables ([`RDEPENDS`][2030], [`RRECOMMENDS`][2031], [`RSUGGESTS`][2032], [`RCONFLICTS`][2033], [`RPROVIDES`][2034], [`RREPLACES`][2035], [`FILES`][2036], `pkg_preinst`, `pkg_postinst`, `pkg_prerm`,`pkg_postrm`, and [`ALLOW_EMPTY`][2037]) should always be set specific to a package (i.e. they should be set with a package name override such as`RDEPENDS_${PN} = "value"` rather than `RDEPENDS = "value"`). If you receive this error, correct any assignments to these variables within your recipe.

*   `File '<file>' from <recipename> was already stripped, this will prevent future debugging! [already-stripped] `[¶][1470]

    Produced binaries have already been stripped prior to the build system extracting debug symbols. It is common for upstream software projects to default to stripping debug symbols for output binaries. In order for debugging to work on the target using `-dbg` packages, this stripping must be disabled.

    Depending on the build system used by the software being built, disabling this stripping could be as easy as specifying an additional configure option. If not, disabling stripping might involve patching the build scripts. In the latter case, look for references to "strip" or "STRIP", or the "-s" or "-S" command-line options being specified on the linker command line (possibly through the compiler command line if preceded with "-Wl,").

    ### Note

    Disabling stripping here does not mean that the final packaged binaries will be unstripped. Once the OpenEmbedded build system splits out debug symbols to the `-dbg` package, it will then strip the symbols from the binaries.

*   `<packagename> is listed in PACKAGES multiple times, this leads to packaging errors. [packages-list] `[¶][1471]

    Package names must appear only once in the [`PACKAGES`][2038] variable. You might receive this error if you are attempting to add a package to `PACKAGES`that is already in the variable's value.

*   `FILES variable for package <packagename> contains '//' which is invalid. Attempting to fix this but you should correct the metadata. [files-invalid] `[¶][1472]

    The string "//" is invalid in a Unix path. Correct all occurrences where this string appears in a [`FILES`][2039] variable so that there is only a single "/".

*   `<recipename>: Files/directories were installed but not shipped in any package [installed-vs-shipped] `[¶][1473]

    Files have been installed within the [`do_install`][2040] task but have not been included in any package by way of the [`FILES`][2041] variable. Files that do not appear in any package cannot be present in an image later on in the build process. You need to do one of the following:

    *   Add the files to `FILES` for the package you want them to appear in (e.g. `FILES_${`[`PN`][67]`}` for the main package).

    *   Delete the files at the end of the `do_install` task if the files are not needed in any package.

*   `<oldpackage>-<oldpkgversion> was registered as shlib provider for <library>, changing it to <newpackage>-<newpkgversion> because it was built later `[¶][1474]

    This message means that both `<oldpackage>` and `<newpackage>` provide the specified shared library. You can expect this message when a recipe has been renamed. However, if that is not the case, the message might indicate that a private version of a library is being erroneously picked up as the provider for a common library. If that is the case, you should add the library's `.so` file name to [`PRIVATE_LIBS`][2042] in the recipe that provides the private version of the library.

### 11.3. Configuring and Disabling QA Checks[¶][1475]

You can configure the QA checks globally so that specific check failures either raise a warning or an error message, using the [`WARN_QA`][4480] and [`ERROR_QA`][4481]variables, respectively. You can also disable checks within a particular recipe using [`INSANE_SKIP`][4482]. For information on how to work with the QA checks, see the "[`insane.bbclass`][4483]" section.

### Tip

Please keep in mind that the QA checks exist in order to detect real or potential problems in the packaged output. So exercise caution when disabling these checks.

### Chapter 12. Images[¶][2043]

The OpenEmbedded build system provides several example images to satisfy different needs. When you issue the `bitbake` command you provide a “top-level” recipe that essentially begins the build for the type of image you want.

### Note

Building an image without GNU General Public License Version 3 (GPLv3), GNU Lesser General Public License Version 3 (LGPLv3), and the GNU Affero General Public License Version 3 (AGPL-3.0) components is only supported for minimal and base images. Furthermore, if you are going to build an image using non-GPLv3 and similarly licensed components, you must make the following changes in the `local.conf` file before using the BitBake command to build the minimal or base image:
```
     1\. Comment out the EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES line
     2\. Set INCOMPATIBLE_LICENSE = "GPL-3.0 LGPL-3.0 AGPL-3.0"

```

From within the `poky` Git repository, you can use the following command to display the list of directories within the [Source Directory][4534] that containe image recipe files:

```
     $ ls meta*/recipes*/images/*.bb

```

Following is a list of supported recipes:

*   `build-appliance-image`: An example virtual machine that contains all the pieces required to run builds using the build system as well as the build system itself. You can boot and run the image using either the [VMware Player][3707] or [VMware Workstation][3708]. For more information on this image, see the[Build Appliance][3709] page on the Yocto Project website.

*   `core-image-base`: A console-only image that fully supports the target device hardware.

*   `core-image-clutter`: An image with support for the Open GL-based toolkit Clutter, which enables development of rich and animated graphical user interfaces.

*   `core-image-full-cmdline`: A console-only image with more full-featured Linux system functionality installed.

*   `core-image-lsb`: An image that conforms to the Linux Standard Base (LSB) specification. This image requires a distribution configuration that enables LSB compliance (e.g. `poky-lsb`). If you build `core-image-lsb` without that configuration, the image will not be LSB-compliant.

*   `core-image-lsb-dev`: A `core-image-lsb` image that is suitable for development work using the host. The image includes headers and libraries you can use in a host development environment. This image requires a distribution configuration that enables LSB compliance (e.g. `poky-lsb`). If you build `core-image-lsb-dev` without that configuration, the image will not be LSB-compliant.

*   `core-image-lsb-sdk`: A `core-image-lsb` that includes everything in the cross-toolchain but also includes development headers and libraries to form a complete standalone SDK. This image requires a distribution configuration that enables LSB compliance (e.g. `poky-lsb`). If you build `core-image-lsb-sdk` without that configuration, the image will not be LSB-compliant. This image is suitable for development using the target.

*   `core-image-minimal`: A small image just capable of allowing a device to boot.

*   `core-image-minimal-dev`: A `core-image-minimal` image suitable for development work using the host. The image includes headers and libraries you can use in a host development environment.

*   `core-image-minimal-initramfs`: A `core-image-minimal` image that has the Minimal RAM-based Initial Root Filesystem (initramfs) as part of the kernel, which allows the system to find the first “init” program more efficiently. See the [`PACKAGE_INSTALL`][3710] variable for additional information helpful when working with initramfs images.

*   `core-image-minimal-mtdutils`: A `core-image-minimal` image that has support for the Minimal MTD Utilities, which let the user interact with the MTD subsystem in the kernel to perform operations on flash devices.

*   `core-image-rt`: A `core-image-minimal` image plus a real-time test suite and tools appropriate for real-time use.

*   `core-image-rt-sdk`: A `core-image-rt` image that includes everything in the cross-toolchain. The image also includes development headers and libraries to form a complete stand-alone SDK and is suitable for development using the target.

*   `core-image-sato`: An image with Sato support, a mobile environment and visual style that works well with mobile devices. The image supports X11 with a Sato theme and applications such as a terminal, editor, file manager, media player, and so forth.

*   `core-image-sato-dev`: A `core-image-sato` image suitable for development using the host. The image includes libraries needed to build applications on the device itself, testing and profiling tools, and debug symbols. This image was formerly `core-image-sdk`.

*   `core-image-sato-sdk`: A `core-image-sato` image that includes everything in the cross-toolchain. The image also includes development headers and libraries to form a complete standalone SDK and is suitable for development using the target.

*   `core-image-testmaster`: A "master" image designed to be used for automated runtime testing. Provides a "known good" image that is deployed to a separate partition so that you can boot into it and use it to deploy a second image to be tested. You can find more information about runtime testing in the "[Performing Automated Runtime Testing][3711]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

*   `core-image-testmaster-initramfs`: A RAM-based Initial Root Filesystem (initramfs) image tailored for use with the `core-image-testmaster`image.

*   `core-image-weston`: A very basic Wayland image with a terminal. This image provides the Wayland protocol libraries and the reference Weston compositor. For more information, see the "[Wayland][3712]" section.

*   `core-image-x11`: A very basic X11 image with a terminal.

### Chapter 13. Features[¶][2044]

**Table of Contents**

<dl style="padding: 0em; margin: 0em 0em 0.5em;">

</dl>

This chapter provides a reference of shipped machine and distro features you can include as part of your image, a reference on image features you can select, and a reference on feature backfilling.

Features provide a mechanism for working out which packages should be included in the generated images. Distributions can select which features they want to support through the `[DISTRO_FEATURES][4484]` variable, which is set or appended to in a distribution's configuration file such as `poky.conf`, `poky-tiny.conf`, `poky-lsb.conf` and so forth. Machine features are set in the `[MACHINE_FEATURES][4485]` variable, which is set in the machine configuration file and specifies the hardware features for a given machine.

These two variables combine to work out which kernel modules, utilities, and other packages to include. A given distribution can support a selected subset of features so some machine features might not be included if the distribution itself does not support them.

One method you can use to determine which recipes are checking to see if a particular feature is contained or not is to `grep` through the [Metadata][4535] for the feature. Here is an example that discovers the recipes whose build is potentially changed based on a given feature:

```
     $ cd poky
     $ git grep 'contains.*MACHINE_FEATURES.*feature'

```

### 13.1. Machine Features[¶][1476]

The items below are features you can use with [`MACHINE_FEATURES`][4486]. Features do not have a one-to-one correspondence to packages, and they can go beyond simply controlling the installation of a package or packages. Sometimes a feature can influence how certain recipes are built. For example, a feature might determine whether a particular configure option is specified within the [`do_configure`][4487] task for a particular recipe.

This feature list only represents features as shipped with the Yocto Project metadata:

*   _acpi:_  Hardware has ACPI (x86/x86_64 only)

*   _alsa:_  Hardware has ALSA audio drivers

*   _apm:_  Hardware uses APM (or APM emulation)

*   _bluetooth:_  Hardware has integrated BT

*   _efi:_  Support for booting through EFI

*   _ext2:_  Hardware HDD or Microdrive

*   _irda:_  Hardware has IrDA support

*   _keyboard:_  Hardware has a keyboard

*   _pcbios:_  Support for booting through BIOS

*   _pci:_  Hardware has a PCI bus

*   _pcmcia:_  Hardware has PCMCIA or CompactFlash sockets

*   _phone:_  Mobile phone (voice) support

*   _qvga:_  Machine has a QVGA (320x240) display

*   _rtc:_  Machine has a Real-Time Clock

*   _screen:_  Hardware has a screen

*   _serial:_  Hardware has serial support (usually RS232)

*   _touchscreen:_  Hardware has a touchscreen

*   _usbgadget:_  Hardware is USB gadget device capable

*   _usbhost:_  Hardware is USB Host capable

*   _vfat:_  FAT file system support

*   _wifi:_  Hardware has integrated WiFi

### 13.2. Distro Features[¶][1477]

The items below are features you can use with [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][4488] to enable features across your distribution. Features do not have a one-to-one correspondence to packages, and they can go beyond simply controlling the installation of a package or packages. In most cases, the presence or absence of a feature translates to the appropriate option supplied to the configure script during the [`do_configure`][4489] task for the recipes that optionally support the feature.

Some distro features are also machine features. These select features make sense to be controlled both at the machine and distribution configuration level. See the [`COMBINED_FEATURES`][4490] variable for more information.

This list only represents features as shipped with the Yocto Project metadata:

*   _alsa:_  Include ALSA support (OSS compatibility kernel modules installed if available).

*   _api-documentation:_  Enables generation of API documentation during recipe builds. The resulting documentation is added to SDK tarballs when the `bitbake -c populate_sdk` command is used. See the "[Adding API Documentation to the Standard SDK][2045]" section in the Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK) Developer's Guide for more information.

*   _bluetooth:_  Include bluetooth support (integrated BT only).

*   _bluez5:_  Include BlueZ Version 5, which provides core Bluetooth layers and protocols support.

    ### Note

    The default value for the [`DISTRO FEATURES`][2046] variable includes "bluetooth", which causes bluez5 to be backfilled in for bluetooth support. If you do not want bluez5 backfilled and would rather use bluez4, you need to use the[`DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED`][2047] variable as follows:
    ```
         DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED = "bluez5"

    ```
    Setting this variable tells the OpenEmbedded build system that you have considered but ruled out using the bluez5 feature and that bluez4 will be used.

*   _cramfs:_  Include CramFS support.

*   _directfb:_  Include DirectFB support.

*   _ext2:_  Include tools for supporting for devices with internal HDD/Microdrive for storing files (instead of Flash only devices).

*   _ipsec:_  Include IPSec support.

*   _ipv6:_  Include IPv6 support.

*   _irda:_  Include IrDA support.

*   _keyboard:_  Include keyboard support (e.g. keymaps will be loaded during boot).

*   _ldconfig:_  Include support for ldconfig and `ld.so.conf` on the target.

*   _nfs:_  Include NFS client support (for mounting NFS exports on device).

*   _opengl:_  Include the Open Graphics Library, which is a cross-language, multi-platform application programming interface used for rendering two and three-dimensional graphics.

*   _pci:_  Include PCI bus support.

*   _pcmcia:_  Include PCMCIA/CompactFlash support.

*   _ppp:_  Include PPP dialup support.

*   _ptest:_  Enables building the package tests where supported by individual recipes. For more information on package tests, see the "[Testing Packages With ptest][2048]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

*   _smbfs:_  Include SMB networks client support (for mounting Samba/Microsoft Windows shares on device).

*   _systemd:_  Include support for this `init` manager, which is a full replacement of for `init` with parallel starting of services, reduced shell overhead, and other features. This `init` manager is used by many distributions.

*   _usbgadget:_  Include USB Gadget Device support (for USB networking/serial/storage).

*   _usbhost:_  Include USB Host support (allows to connect external keyboard, mouse, storage, network etc).

*   _wayland:_  Include the Wayland display server protocol and the library that supports it.

*   _wifi:_  Include WiFi support (integrated only).

*   _x11:_  Include the X server and libraries.

### 13.3. Image Features[¶][1478]

The contents of images generated by the OpenEmbedded build system can be controlled by the [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][4491] and [`EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES`][4492]variables that you typically configure in your image recipes. Through these variables, you can add several different predefined packages such as development utilities or packages with debug information needed to investigate application problems or profile applications.

The following image features are available for all images:

*   _allow-empty-password:_  Allows Dropbear and OpenSSH to accept root logins and logins from accounts having an empty password string.

*   _dbg-pkgs:_  Installs debug symbol packages for all packages installed in a given image.

*   _debug-tweaks:_  Makes an image suitable for development (e.g. allows root logins without passwords and enables post-installation logging). See the 'allow-empty-password', 'empty-root-password', and 'post-install-logging' features in this list for additional information.

*   _dev-pkgs:_  Installs development packages (headers and extra library links) for all packages installed in a given image.

*   _doc-pkgs:_  Installs documentation packages for all packages installed in a given image.

*   _empty-root-password:_  Sets the root password to an empty string, which allows logins with a blank password.

*   _package-management:_  Installs package management tools and preserves the package manager database.

*   _post-install-logging:_  Enables logging postinstall script runs to the `/var/log/postinstall.log` file on first boot of the image on the target system.

    ### Note

    To make the `/var/log` directory on the target persistent, use the [`VOLATILE_LOG_DIR`][2049] variable by setting it to "no".

*   _ptest-pkgs:_  Installs ptest packages for all ptest-enabled recipes.

*   _read-only-rootfs:_  Creates an image whose root filesystem is read-only. See the "[Creating a Read-Only Root Filesystem][2050]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual for more information.

*   _splash:_  Enables showing a splash screen during boot. By default, this screen is provided by `psplash`, which does allow customization. If you prefer to use an alternative splash screen package, you can do so by setting the `SPLASH` variable to a different package name (or names) within the image recipe or at the distro configuration level.

*   _staticdev-pkgs:_  Installs static development packages, which are static libraries (i.e. `*.a` files), for all packages installed in a given image.

Some image features are available only when you inherit the [`core-image`][4493] class. The current list of these valid features is as follows:

*   _eclipse-debug:_  Provides Eclipse remote debugging support.

*   _hwcodecs:_  Installs hardware acceleration codecs.

*   _nfs-server:_  Installs an NFS server.

*   _perf:_  Installs profiling tools such as `perf`, `systemtap`, and `LTTng`. For general information on user-space tools, see the [Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK) Developer's Guide][2051].

*   _ssh-server-dropbear:_  Installs the Dropbear minimal SSH server.

*   _ssh-server-openssh:_  Installs the OpenSSH SSH server, which is more full-featured than Dropbear. Note that if both the OpenSSH SSH server and the Dropbear minimal SSH server are present in `IMAGE_FEATURES`, then OpenSSH will take precedence and Dropbear will not be installed.

*   _tools-debug:_  Installs debugging tools such as `strace` and `gdb`. For information on GDB, see the "[Debugging With the GNU Project Debugger (GDB) Remotely][2052]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual. For information on tracing and profiling, see the [Yocto Project Profiling and Tracing Manual][2053].

*   _tools-sdk:_  Installs a full SDK that runs on the device.

*   _tools-testapps:_  Installs device testing tools (e.g. touchscreen debugging).

*   _x11:_  Installs the X server.

*   _x11-base:_  Installs the X server with a minimal environment.

*   _x11-sato:_  Installs the OpenedHand Sato environment.

### 13.4. Feature Backfilling[¶][1479]

Sometimes it is necessary in the OpenEmbedded build system to extend [`MACHINE_FEATURES`][4494] or [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][4495] to control functionality that was previously enabled and not able to be disabled. For these cases, we need to add an additional feature item to appear in one of these variables, but we do not want to force developers who have existing values of the variables in their configuration to add the new feature in order to retain the same overall level of functionality. Thus, the OpenEmbedded build system has a mechanism to automatically "backfill" these added features into existing distro or machine configurations. You can see the list of features for which this is done by finding the [`DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL`][4496] and [`MACHINE_FEATURES_BACKFILL`][4497] variables in the `meta/conf/bitbake.conf` file.

Because such features are backfilled by default into all configurations as described in the previous paragraph, developers who wish to disable the new features need to be able to selectively prevent the backfilling from occurring. They can do this by adding the undesired feature or features to the[`DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED`][4498] or [`MACHINE_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED`][4499] variables for distro features and machine features respectively.

Here are two examples to help illustrate feature backfilling:

*   _The "pulseaudio" distro feature option_ : Previously, PulseAudio support was enabled within the Qt and GStreamer frameworks. Because of this, the feature is backfilled and thus enabled for all distros through the `DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL` variable in the `meta/conf/bitbake.conf` file. However, your distro needs to disable the feature. You can disable the feature without affecting other existing distro configurations that need PulseAudio support by adding "pulseaudio" to `DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED` in your distro's `.conf` file. Adding the feature to this variable when it also exists in the `DISTRO_FEATURES_BACKFILL` variable prevents the build system from adding the feature to your configuration's `DISTRO_FEATURES`, effectively disabling the feature for that particular distro.

*   _The "rtc" machine feature option_ : Previously, real time clock (RTC) support was enabled for all target devices. Because of this, the feature is backfilled and thus enabled for all machines through the `MACHINE_FEATURES_BACKFILL` variable in the `meta/conf/bitbake.conf` file. However, your target device does not have this capability. You can disable RTC support for your device without affecting other machines that need RTC support by adding the feature to your machine's `MACHINE_FEATURES_BACKFILL_CONSIDERED` list in the machine's `.conf` file. Adding the feature to this variable when it also exists in the `MACHINE_FEATURES_BACKFILL` variable prevents the build system from adding the feature to your configuration's `MACHINE_FEATURES`, effectively disabling RTC support for that particular machine.

### Chapter 14. Variables Glossary[¶][2054]

This chapter lists common variables used in the OpenEmbedded build system and gives an overview of their function and contents.

### Glossary[¶][1480]

[A][4500] [B][4501] [C][4502] [D][4503] [E][4504] [F][4505] [G][4506] [H][4507] [I][4508] [K][4509] [L][4510] [M][4511] [O][4512] [P][4513] [R][4514] [S][4515] [T][4516] [U][4517] [V][4518] [W][4519] [X][4520]

### A


Extension to the Application Binary Interface (ABI) field of the GNU canonical architecture name (e.g. "eabi").

ABI extensions are set in the machine include files. For example, the`meta/conf/machine/include/arm/arch-arm.inc` file sets the following extension:

```
     ABIEXTENSION = "eabi"

```

Specifies if an output package should still be produced if it is empty. By default, BitBake does not produce empty packages. This default behavior can cause issues when there is an [`RDEPENDS`][2057] or some other hard runtime requirement on the existence of the package.

Like all package-controlling variables, you must always use them in conjunction with a package name override, as in:

```
     ALLOW_EMPTY_${PN} = "1"
     ALLOW_EMPTY_${PN}-dev = "1"
     ALLOW_EMPTY_${PN}-staticdev = "1"

```

Lists commands in a package that need an alternative binary naming scheme. Sometimes the same command is provided in multiple packages. When this occurs, the OpenEmbedded build system needs to use the alternatives system to create a different binary naming scheme so the commands can co-exist.

To use the variable, list out the package's commands that also exist as part of another package. For example, if the `busybox` package has four commands that also exist as part of another package, you identify them as follows:

```
     ALTERNATIVE_busybox = "sh sed test bracket"

```

For more information on the alternatives system, see the "[`update-alternatives.bbclass`][2059]" section.


Used by the alternatives system to map duplicated commands to actual locations. For example, if the `bracket` command provided by the `busybox` package is duplicated through another package, you must use the `ALTERNATIVE_LINK_NAME` variable to specify the actual location:

```
     ALTERNATIVE_LINK_NAME[bracket] = "/usr/bin/["

```

In this example, the binary for the `bracket` command (i.e. `[`) from the `busybox` package resides in`/usr/bin/`.

### Note

If `ALTERNATIVE_LINK_NAME` is not defined, it defaults to `${bindir}/ _`name`_` .

For more information on the alternatives system, see the "[`update-alternatives.bbclass`][2061]" section.


Used by the alternatives system to create default priorities for duplicated commands. You can use the variable to create a single default regardless of the command name or package, a default for specific duplicated commands regardless of the package, or a default for specific commands tied to particular packages. Here are the available syntax forms:

```
     ALTERNATIVE_PRIORITY = "priority"
     ALTERNATIVE_PRIORITY[name] = "priority"
     ALTERNATIVE_PRIORITY_pkg[name] = "priority"

```

For more information on the alternatives system, see the "[`update-alternatives.bbclass`][2063]" section.


Used by the alternatives system to create default link locations for duplicated commands. You can use the variable to create a single default location for all duplicated commands regardless of the command name or package, a default for specific duplicated commands regardless of the package, or a default for specific commands tied to particular packages. Here are the available syntax forms:

```
     ALTERNATIVE_TARGET = "target"
     ALTERNATIVE_TARGET[name] = "target"
     ALTERNATIVE_TARGET_pkg[name] = "target"

```

### Note

If `ALTERNATIVE_TARGET` is not defined, it inherits the value from the[`ALTERNATIVE_LINK_NAME`][1481] variable.

If `ALTERNATIVE_LINK_NAME` and `ALTERNATIVE_TARGET` are the same, the target for `ALTERNATIVE_TARGET` has "`.{BPN}`" appended to it.

Finally, if the file referenced has not been renamed, the alternatives system will rename it to avoid the need to rename alternative files in the [`do_install`][1482] task while retaining support for the command if necessary.

For more information on the alternatives system, see the "[`update-alternatives.bbclass`][2065]" section.


An override list of append strings for each [`LABEL`][2067].

See the [`grub-efi`][2068] class for more information on how this variable is used.


The minimal command and arguments used to run `ar`.


When used with the [`archiver`][2071] class, determines the type of information used to create a released archive. You can use this variable to create archives of patched source, original source, configured source, and so forth by employing the following variable flags (varflags):

```
     ARCHIVER_MODE[src] = "original"                 # Uses original (unpacked) source
                                                     # files.

     ARCHIVER_MODE[src] = "patched"                  # Uses patched source files. This is
                                                     # the default.

     ARCHIVER_MODE[src] = "configured"               # Uses configured source files.

     ARCHIVER_MODE[diff] = "1"                       # Uses patches between do_unpack and
                                                     # do_patch.

     ARCHIVER_MODE[diff-exclude] ?= "file file ..."  # Lists files and directories to
                                                     # exclude from diff.

     ARCHIVER_MODE[dumpdata] = "1"                   # Uses environment data.

     ARCHIVER_MODE[recipe] = "1"                     # Uses recipe and include files.

     ARCHIVER_MODE[srpm] = "1"                       # Uses RPM package files.

```

For information on how the variable works, see the `meta/classes/archiver.bbclass` file in the[Source Directory][2072].


The minimal command and arguments used to run the assembler.

Lists recipe names ([`PN`][2075] values) BitBake does not attempt to build. Instead, BitBake assumes these recipes have already been built.

In OpenEmbedded Core, `ASSUME_PROVIDED` mostly specifies native tools that should not be built. An example is `git-native`, which when specified, allows for the Git binary from the host to be used rather than building `git-native`.



Provides additional `shlibs` provider mapping information, which adds to or overwrites the information provided automatically by the system. Separate multiple entries using spaces.

As an example, use the following form to add an `shlib` provider of  _`shlibname`_  in  _`packagename`_  with the optional  _`version`_ :

```
     shlibname:packagename[_version]

```

Here is an example that adds a shared library named `libEGL.so.1` as being provided by the `libegl-implementation` package:

```
     ASSUME_SHLIBS = "libEGL.so.1:libegl-implementation"

```

The email address used to contact the original author or authors in order to send patches and forward bugs.


When the [`debian`][2079] class is inherited, which is the default behavior, `AUTO_LIBNAME_PKGS` specifies which packages should be checked for libraries and renamed according to Debian library package naming.

The default value is "${PACKAGES}", which causes the debian class to act on all packages that are explicitly generated by the recipe.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">AUTO_SYSLINUXMENU[¶][2080]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Enables creating an automatic menu for the syslinux bootloader. You must set this variable in your recipe. The [`syslinux`][2081] class checks this variable.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">AUTOREV[¶][2082]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When `[SRCREV][1483]` is set to the value of this variable, it specifies to use the latest source revision in the repository. Here is an example:

```
     SRCREV = "${AUTOREV}"

```

If you use the previous statement to retrieve the latest version of software, you need to be sure [`PV`][2083]contains `${`[`SRCPV`][2084]`}`. For example, suppose you have a kernel recipe that inherits the [kernel][2085] class and you use the previous statement. In this example, `${SRCPV}` does not automatically get into `PV`. Consequently, you need to change `PV` in your recipe so that it does contain `${SRCPV}`.

For more information see the "[Automatically Incrementing a Binary Package Revision Number][2086]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">AVAILTUNES[¶][2087]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The list of defined CPU and Application Binary Interface (ABI) tunings (i.e. "tunes") available for use by the OpenEmbedded build system.

The list simply presents the tunes that are available. Not all tunes may be compatible with a particular machine configuration, or with each other in a [Multilib][2088] configuration.

To add a tune to the list, be sure to append it with spaces using the "+=" BitBake operator. Do not simply replace the list by using the "=" operator. See the "[Basic Syntax][2089]" section in the BitBake User Manual for more information.

</dd>

</dl>

### B

<dl style="padding-top: 0em;">

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">B[¶][2090]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The directory within the [Build Directory][2091] in which the OpenEmbedded build system places generated objects during a recipe's build process. By default, this directory is the same as the [`S`][2092] directory, which is defined as:

```
     S = "${WORKDIR}/${BP}"

```

You can separate the (`S`) directory and the directory pointed to by the `B` variable. Most Autotools-based recipes support separating these directories. The build system defaults to using separate directories for `gcc` and some kernel recipes.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BAD_RECOMMENDATIONS[¶][2093]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Lists "recommended-only" packages to not install. Recommended-only packages are packages installed only through the [`RRECOMMENDS`][2094] variable. You can prevent any of these "recommended" packages from being installed by listing them with the `BAD_RECOMMENDATIONS` variable:

```
     BAD_RECOMMENDATIONS = "package_name package_name package_name ..."

```

You can set this variable globally in your `local.conf` file or you can attach it to a specific image recipe by using the recipe name override:

```
     BAD_RECOMMENDATIONS_pn-target_image = "package_name"

```

It is important to realize that if you choose to not install packages using this variable and some other packages are dependent on them (i.e. listed in a recipe's [`RDEPENDS`][2095] variable), the OpenEmbedded build system ignores your request and will install the packages to avoid dependency errors.

Support for this variable exists only when using the IPK and RPM packaging backend. Support does not exist for DEB.

See the [`NO_RECOMMENDATIONS`][2096] and the [`PACKAGE_EXCLUDE`][2097] variables for related information.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BASE_LIB[¶][2098]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The library directory name for the CPU or Application Binary Interface (ABI) tune. The `BASE_LIB`applies only in the Multilib context. See the "[Combining Multiple Versions of Library Files into One Image][2099]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual for information on Multilib.

The `BASE_LIB` variable is defined in the machine include files in the [Source Directory][2100]. If Multilib is not being used, the value defaults to "lib".

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BASE_WORKDIR[¶][2101]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Points to the base of the work directory for all recipes. The default value is "${TMPDIR}/work".

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BB_ALLOWED_NETWORKS[¶][2102]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies a space-delimited list of hosts that the fetcher is allowed to use to obtain the required source code. Following are considerations surrounding this variable:

*   This host list is only used if `BB_NO_NETWORK` is either not set or set to "0".

*   Limited support for wildcard matching against the beginning of host names exists. For example, the following setting matches `git.gnu.org`, `ftp.gnu.org`, and `foo.git.gnu.org`.

    ```
         BB_ALLOWED_NETWORKS = "*.gnu.org"

    ```

*   Mirrors not in the host list are skipped and logged in debug.

*   Attempts to access networks not in the host list cause a failure.

Using `BB_ALLOWED_NETWORKS` in conjunction with [`PREMIRRORS`][2103] is very useful. Adding the host you want to use to `PREMIRRORS` results in the source code being fetched from an allowed location and avoids raising an error when a host that is not allowed is in a [`SRC_URI`][2104] statement. This is because the fetcher does not attempt to use the host listed in `SRC_URI` after a successful fetch from the`PREMIRRORS` occurs.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BB_DANGLINGAPPENDS_WARNONLY[¶][2105]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Defines how BitBake handles situations where an append file (`.bbappend`) has no corresponding recipe file (`.bb`). This condition often occurs when layers get out of sync (e.g. `oe-core` bumps a recipe version and the old recipe no longer exists and the other layer has not been updated to the new version of the recipe yet).

The default fatal behavior is safest because it is the sane reaction given something is out of sync. It is important to realize when your changes are no longer being applied.

You can change the default behavior by setting this variable to "1", "yes", or "true" in your `local.conf` file, which is located in the [Build Directory][2106]: Here is an example:

```
     BB_DANGLINGAPPENDS_WARNONLY = "1"

```
</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BB_DISKMON_DIRS[¶][2107]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Monitors disk space and available inodes during the build and allows you to control the build based on these parameters.

Disk space monitoring is disabled by default. To enable monitoring, add the `BB_DISKMON_DIRS`variable to your `conf/local.conf` file found in the [Build Directory][2108]. Use the following form:

```
     BB_DISKMON_DIRS = "action,dir,threshold [...]"

     where:

        action is:
           ABORT:     Immediately abort the build when
                      a threshold is broken.
           STOPTASKS: Stop the build after the currently
                      executing tasks have finished when
                      a threshold is broken.
           WARN:      Issue a warning but continue the
                      build when a threshold is broken.
                      Subsequent warnings are issued as
                      defined by the
                      BB_DISKMON_WARNINTERVAL variable,
                      which must be defined in the
                      conf/local.conf file.

        dir is:
           Any directory you choose. You can specify one or
           more directories to monitor by separating the
           groupings with a space.  If two directories are
           on the same device, only the first directory
           is monitored.

        threshold is:
           Either the minimum available disk space,
           the minimum number of free inodes, or
           both.  You must specify at least one.  To
           omit one or the other, simply omit the value.
           Specify the threshold using G, M, K for Gbytes,
           Mbytes, and Kbytes, respectively. If you do
           not specify G, M, or K, Kbytes is assumed by
           default.  Do not use GB, MB, or KB.

```

Here are some examples:

```
     BB_DISKMON_DIRS = "ABORT,${TMPDIR},1G,100K WARN,${SSTATE_DIR},1G,100K"
     BB_DISKMON_DIRS = "STOPTASKS,${TMPDIR},1G"
     BB_DISKMON_DIRS = "ABORT,${TMPDIR},,100K"

```

The first example works only if you also provide the [`BB_DISKMON_WARNINTERVAL`][2110] variable in the `conf/local.conf`. This example causes the build system to immediately abort when either the disk space in `${TMPDIR}` drops below 1 Gbyte or the available free inodes drops below 100 Kbytes. Because two directories are provided with the variable, the build system also issue a warning when the disk space in the `${SSTATE_DIR}` directory drops below 1 Gbyte or the number of free inodes drops below 100 Kbytes. Subsequent warnings are issued during intervals as defined by the `BB_DISKMON_WARNINTERVAL` variable.

The second example stops the build after all currently executing tasks complete when the minimum disk space in the `${[TMPDIR][1484]}` directory drops below 1 Gbyte. No disk monitoring occurs for the free inodes in this case.

The final example immediately aborts the build when the number of free inodes in the `${TMPDIR}`directory drops below 100 Kbytes. No disk space monitoring for the directory itself occurs in this case.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BB_DISKMON_WARNINTERVAL[¶][2111]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Defines the disk space and free inode warning intervals. To set these intervals, define the variable in your `conf/local.conf` file in the [Build Directory][2112].

If you are going to use the `BB_DISKMON_WARNINTERVAL` variable, you must also use the[`BB_DISKMON_DIRS`][2113] variable and define its action as "WARN". During the build, subsequent warnings are issued each time disk space or number of free inodes further reduces by the respective interval.

If you do not provide a `BB_DISKMON_WARNINTERVAL` variable and you do use `BB_DISKMON_DIRS` with the "WARN" action, the disk monitoring interval defaults to the following:

```
     BB_DISKMON_WARNINTERVAL = "50M,5K"

```

When specifying the variable in your configuration file, use the following form:

```
     BB_DISKMON_WARNINTERVAL = "disk_space_interval,disk_inode_interval"

     where:

        disk_space_interval is:
           An interval of memory expressed in either
           G, M, or K for Gbytes, Mbytes, or Kbytes,
           respectively. You cannot use GB, MB, or KB.

        disk_inode_interval is:
           An interval of free inodes expressed in either
           G, M, or K for Gbytes, Mbytes, or Kbytes,
           respectively. You cannot use GB, MB, or KB.

```

Here is an example:

```
     BB_DISKMON_DIRS = "WARN,${SSTATE_DIR},1G,100K"
     BB_DISKMON_WARNINTERVAL = "50M,5K"

```

These variables cause the OpenEmbedded build system to issue subsequent warnings each time the available disk space further reduces by 50 Mbytes or the number of free inodes further reduces by 5 Kbytes in the `${SSTATE_DIR}` directory. Subsequent warnings based on the interval occur each time a respective interval is reached beyond the initial warning (i.e. 1 Gbytes and 100 Kbytes).

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS[¶][2114]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Causes tarballs of the Git repositories, including the Git metadata, to be placed in the [`DL_DIR`][2115]directory.

For performance reasons, creating and placing tarballs of the Git repositories is not the default action by the OpenEmbedded build system.

```
     BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS = "1"

```

Set this variable in your `local.conf` file in the [Build Directory][2116].

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BB_NUMBER_THREADS[¶][2117]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The maximum number of tasks BitBake should run in parallel at any one time. The OpenEmbedded build system automatically configures this variable to be equal to the number of cores on the build system. For example, a system with a dual core processor that also uses hyper-threading causes the`BB_NUMBER_THREADS` variable to default to "4".

For single socket systems (i.e. one CPU), you should not have to override this variable to gain optimal parallelism during builds. However, if you have very large systems that employ multiple physical CPUs, you might want to make sure the `BB_NUMBER_THREADS` variable is not set higher than "20".

For more information on speeding up builds, see the "[Speeding Up the Build][2118]" section.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BBCLASSEXTEND[¶][2119]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Allows you to extend a recipe so that it builds variants of the software. Common variants for recipes exist such as "natives" like `quilt-native`, which is a copy of Quilt built to run on the build system; "crosses" such as `gcc-cross`, which is a compiler built to run on the build machine but produces binaries that run on the target [`MACHINE`][2120]; "nativesdk", which targets the SDK machine instead of `MACHINE`; and "mulitlibs" in the form "`multilib:` _`multilib_name`_ ".

To build a different variant of the recipe with a minimal amount of code, it usually is as simple as adding the following to your recipe:

```
     BBCLASSEXTEND =+ "native nativesdk"
     BBCLASSEXTEND =+ "multilib:multilib_name"

```

### Note

Internally, the `BBCLASSEXTEND` mechanism generates recipe variants by rewriting variable values and applying overrides such as `_class-native`. For example, to generate a native version of a recipe, a [`DEPENDS`][1485] on "foo" is rewritten to a `DEPENDS` on "foo-native".

Even when using `BBCLASSEXTEND`, the recipe is only parsed once. Parsing once adds some limitations. For example, it is not possible to include a different file depending on the variant, since `include` statements are processed when the recipe is parsed.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BBFILE_COLLECTIONS[¶][2121]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Lists the names of configured layers. These names are used to find the other `BBFILE_*` variables. Typically, each layer will append its name to this variable in its `conf/layer.conf` file.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BBFILE_PATTERN[¶][2122]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Variable that expands to match files from [`BBFILES`][2123] in a particular layer. This variable is used in the `conf/layer.conf` file and must be suffixed with the name of the specific layer (e.g.`BBFILE_PATTERN_emenlow`).

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BBFILE_PRIORITY[¶][2124]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Assigns the priority for recipe files in each layer.

This variable is useful in situations where the same recipe appears in more than one layer. Setting this variable allows you to prioritize a layer against other layers that contain the same recipe - effectively letting you control the precedence for the multiple layers. The precedence established through this variable stands regardless of a recipe's version ([`PV`][2125] variable). For example, a layer that has a recipe with a higher `PV` value but for which the `BBFILE_PRIORITY` is set to have a lower precedence still has a lower precedence.

A larger value for the `BBFILE_PRIORITY` variable results in a higher precedence. For example, the value 6 has a higher precedence than the value 5\. If not specified, the `BBFILE_PRIORITY` variable is set based on layer dependencies (see the `[LAYERDEPENDS][1486]` variable for more information. The default priority, if unspecified for a layer with no dependencies, is the lowest defined priority + 1 (or 1 if no priorities are defined).

### Tip

You can use the command `bitbake-layers show-layers` to list all configured layers along with their priorities.</dd>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

If [`BBINCLUDELOGS`][2129] is set, specifies the maximum number of lines from the task log file to print when reporting a failed task. If you do not set `BBINCLUDELOGS_LINES`, the entire log is printed.

</dd>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Lists the layers to enable during the build. This variable is defined in the `bblayers.conf`configuration file in the [Build Directory][2131]. Here is an example:

```
     BBLAYERS = " \
       /home/scottrif/poky/meta \
       /home/scottrif/poky/meta-poky \
       /home/scottrif/poky/meta-yocto-bsp \
       /home/scottrif/poky/meta-mykernel \
       "

```

This example enables four layers, one of which is a custom, user-defined layer named `meta-mykernel`.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BBMASK[¶][2132]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Prevents BitBake from processing recipes and recipe append files.

You can use the `BBMASK` variable to "hide" these `.bb` and `.bbappend` files. BitBake ignores any recipe or recipe append files that match any of the expressions. It is as if BitBake does not see them at all. Consequently, matching files are not parsed or otherwise used by BitBake.

The values you provide are passed to Python's regular expression compiler. The expressions are compared against the full paths to the files. For complete syntax information, see Python's documentation at [http://docs.python.org/release/2.3/lib/re-syntax.html][2133].

The following example uses a complete regular expression to tell BitBake to ignore all recipe and recipe append files in the `meta-ti/recipes-misc/` directory:

```
     BBMASK = "meta-ti/recipes-misc/"

```

If you want to mask out multiple directories or recipes, you can specify multiple regular expression fragments. This next example masks out multiple directories and individual recipes:

```
     BBMASK += "/meta-ti/recipes-misc/ meta-ti/recipes-ti/packagegroup/"
     BBMASK += "/meta-oe/recipes-support/"
     BBMASK += "/meta-foo/.*/openldap"
     BBMASK += "opencv.*\.bbappend"
     BBMASK += "lzma"

```

### Note

When specifying a directory name, use the trailing slash character to ensure you match just that directory name.</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BBMULTICONFIG[¶][2134]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies each separate configuration when you are building targets with multiple configurations. Use this variable in your `conf/local.conf` configuration file. Specify a  _`multiconfigname`_  for each configuration file you are using. For example, the following line specifies three configuration files:

```
     BBMULTIFONFIG = "configA configB configC"

```

Each configuration file you use must reside in the [Build Directory's][2135] `conf/multiconfig` directory (e.g.  _`build_directory`_ `/conf/multiconfig/configA.conf`).

For information on how to use `BBMULTICONFIG` in an environment that supports building targets with multiple configurations, see the "[Building Targets with Multiple Configurations][2136]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Used by BitBake to locate `.bbclass` and configuration files. This variable is analogous to the `PATH`variable.

### Note

If you run BitBake from a directory outside of the [Build Directory][2138], you must be sure to set `BBPATH` to point to the Build Directory. Set the variable as you would any environment variable and then run BitBake:
```
     $ BBPATH = "build_directory"
     $ export BBPATH
     $ bitbake target

Points to the server that runs memory-resident BitBake. This variable is set by the [`oe-init-build-env-memres`][2140] setup script and should not be hand-edited. The variable is only used when you employ memory-resident BitBake. The setup script exports the value as follows:

```
     export BBSERVER=localhost:$port

```

For more information on how the `BBSERVER` is used, see the `oe-init-build-env-memres` script, which is located in the [Source Directory][2141].

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When inheriting the [`binconfig-disabled`][2143] class, this variable specifies binary configuration scripts to disable in favor of using `pkg-config` to query the information. The `binconfig-disabled` class will modify the specified scripts to return an error so that calls to them can be easily found and replaced.

To add multiple scripts, separate them by spaces. Here is an example from the `libpng` recipe:

```
     BINCONFIG = "${bindir}/libpng-config ${bindir}/libpng16-config"

```
</dd>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When inheriting the [`binconfig`][2145] class, this variable specifies a wildcard for configuration scripts that need editing. The scripts are edited to correct any paths that have been set up during compilation so that they are correct for use when installed into the sysroot and called by the build processes of other recipes.

For more information on how this variable works, see `meta/classes/binconfig.bbclass` in the[Source Directory][2146]. You can also find general information on the class in the "[`binconfig.bbclass`][2147]" section.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BUILD_OPTIMIZATION[¶][2163]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the optimization flags passed to the C compiler when building for the build host or the SDK. The flags are passed through the [`BUILD_CFLAGS`][2164] and [`BUILDSDK_CFLAGS`][2165] default values.

The default value of the `BUILD_OPTIMIZATION` variable is "-O2 -pipe".

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the operating system in use on the build host (e.g. "linux"). The OpenEmbedded build system sets the value of `BUILD_OS` from the OS reported by the `uname` command - the first word, converted to lower-case characters.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BUILD_PREFIX[¶][2167]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The toolchain binary prefix used for native recipes. The OpenEmbedded build system uses the`BUILD_PREFIX` value to set the [`TARGET_PREFIX`][2168] when building for `native` recipes.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BUILD_SYS[¶][2169]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the system, including the architecture and the operating system, to use when building for the build host (i.e. when building `native` recipes).

The OpenEmbedded build system automatically sets this variable based on [`BUILD_ARCH`][2170],[`BUILD_VENDOR`][2171], and [`BUILD_OS`][2172]. You do not need to set the `BUILD_SYS` variable yourself.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BUILD_VENDOR[¶][2173]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Points to the location of the [Build Directory][2175]. You can define this directory indirectly through the [`oe-init-build-env`][2176] and [`oe-init-build-env-memres`][2177] scripts by passing in a Build Directory path when you run the scripts. If you run the scripts and do not provide a Build Directory path, the `BUILDDIR`defaults to `build` in the current directory.

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT[¶][2178]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When inheriting the [`buildhistory`][2179] class, this variable specifies whether or not to commit the build history output in a local Git repository. If set to "1", this local repository will be maintained automatically by the `buildhistory` class and a commit will be created on every build for changes to each top-level subdirectory of the build history output (images, packages, and sdk). If you want to track changes to build history over time, you should set this value to "1".

By default, the `buildhistory` class does not commit the build history output in a local Git repository:

```
     BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT ?= "0"

```
</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT_AUTHOR[¶][2180]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When inheriting the [`buildhistory`][2181] class, this variable specifies the author to use for each Git commit. In order for the `BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT_AUTHOR` variable to work, the [`BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT`][2182]variable must be set to "1".

Git requires that the value you provide for the `BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT_AUTHOR` variable takes the form of "name <email@host>". Providing an email address or host that is not valid does not produce an error.

By default, the `buildhistory` class sets the variable as follows:

```
     BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT_AUTHOR ?= "buildhistory <buildhistory@${DISTRO}>"

```
</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BUILDHISTORY_DIR[¶][2183]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When inheriting the [`buildhistory`][2184] class, this variable specifies the directory in which build history information is kept. For more information on how the variable works, see the `buildhistory.class`.

By default, the `buildhistory` class sets the directory as follows:

```
     BUILDHISTORY_DIR ?= "${TOPDIR}/buildhistory"

```
</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BUILDHISTORY_FEATURES[¶][2185]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When inheriting the [`buildhistory`][2186] class, this variable specifies the build history features to be enabled. For more information on how build history works, see the "[Maintaining Build Output Quality][2187]" section.

You can specify three features in the form of a space-separated list:

*   _image:_  Analysis of the contents of images, which includes the list of installed packages among other things.

*   _package:_  Analysis of the contents of individual packages.

*   _sdk:_  Analysis of the contents of the software development kit (SDK).

By default, the `buildhistory` class enables all three features:

```
     BUILDHISTORY_FEATURES ?= "image package sdk"

```
</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BUILDHISTORY_IMAGE_FILES[¶][2188]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When inheriting the [`buildhistory`][2189] class, this variable specifies a list of paths to files copied from the image contents into the build history directory under an "image-files" directory in the directory for the image, so that you can track the contents of each file. The default is to copy `/etc/passwd`and `/etc/group`, which allows you to monitor for changes in user and group entries. You can modify the list to include any file. Specifying an invalid path does not produce an error. Consequently, you can include files that might not always be present.

By default, the `buildhistory` class provides paths to the following files:

```
     BUILDHISTORY_IMAGE_FILES ?= "/etc/passwd /etc/group"

```
</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">BUILDHISTORY_PUSH_REPO[¶][2190]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When inheriting the [`buildhistory`][2191] class, this variable optionally specifies a remote repository to which build history pushes Git changes. In order for `BUILDHISTORY_PUSH_REPO` to work,[`BUILDHISTORY_COMMIT`][2192] must be set to "1".

The repository should correspond to a remote address that specifies a repository as understood by Git, or alternatively to a remote name that you have set up manually using `git remote` within the local repository.

By default, the `buildhistory` class sets the variable as follows:

```
     BUILDHISTORY_PUSH_REPO ?= ""

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

For the BusyBox recipe, specifies whether to split the output executable file into two parts: one for features that require `setuid root`, and one for the remaining features (i.e. those that do not require`setuid root`).

The `BUSYBOX_SPLIT_SUID` variable defaults to "1", which results in a single output executable file. Set the variable to "0" to split the output file.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the flags to pass to the C compiler. This variable is exported to an environment variable and thus made visible to the software being built during the compilation step.

Default initialization for `CFLAGS` varies depending on what is being built:

*   [`TARGET_CFLAGS`][68] when building for the target

*   [`BUILD_CFLAGS`][69] when building for the build host (i.e. `-native`)

*   [`BUILDSDK_CFLAGS`][70] when building for an SDK (i.e. `nativesdk-`)

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">CLASSOVERRIDE[¶][2209]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

An internal variable specifying the special class override that should currently apply (e.g. "class-target", "class-native", and so forth). The classes that use this variable (e.g. [`native`][2210], [`nativesdk`][2211], and so forth) set the variable to appropriate values.

### Note

`CLASSOVERRIDE` gets its default "class-target" value from the `bitbake.conf` file.

As an example, the following override allows you to install extra files, but only when building for the target:

```
     do_install_append_class-target() {
         install my-extra-file ${D}${sysconfdir}
     }

```

Here is an example where `FOO` is set to "native" when building for the build host, and to "other" when not building for the build host:

```
     FOO_class-native = "native"
     FOO = "other"

```

The underlying mechanism behind `CLASSOVERRIDE` is simply that it is included in the default value of[`OVERRIDES`][2212].

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

If set to "1" within a recipe, `CLEANBROKEN` specifies that the `make clean` command does not work for the software being built. Consequently, the OpenEmbedded build system will not try to run `make clean` during the [`do_configure`][2214] task, which is the default behavior.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Provides a list of hardware features that are enabled in both [`MACHINE_FEATURES`][2216] and[`DISTRO_FEATURES`][2217]. This select list of features contains features that make sense to be controlled both at the machine and distribution configuration level. For example, the "bluetooth" feature requires hardware support but should also be optional at the distribution level, in case the hardware supports Bluetooth but you do not ever intend to use it.

For more information, see the [`MACHINE_FEATURES`][2218] and [`DISTRO_FEATURES`][2219] variables.

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">COMPATIBLE_HOST[¶][2222]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A regular expression that resolves to one or more hosts (when the recipe is native) or one or more targets (when the recipe is non-native) with which a recipe is compatible. The regular expression is matched against [`HOST_SYS`][2223]. You can use the variable to stop recipes from being built for classes of systems with which the recipes are not compatible. Stopping these builds is particularly useful with kernels. The variable also helps to increase parsing speed since the build system skips parsing recipes not compatible with the current system.

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">COMPATIBLE_MACHINE[¶][2224]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A regular expression that resolves to one or more target machines with which a recipe is compatible. The regular expression is matched against [`MACHINEOVERRIDES`][2225]. You can use the variable to stop recipes from being built for machines with which the recipes are not compatible. Stopping these builds is particularly useful with kernels. The variable also helps to increase parsing speed since the build system skips parsing recipes not compatible with the current machine.

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">COMPLEMENTARY_GLOB[¶][2226]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Defines wildcards to match when installing a list of complementary packages for all the packages explicitly (or implicitly) installed in an image. The resulting list of complementary packages is associated with an item that can be added to [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][2227]. An example usage of this is the "dev-pkgs" item that when added to `IMAGE_FEATURES` will install -dev packages (containing headers and other development files) for every package in the image.

To add a new feature item pointing to a wildcard, use a variable flag to specify the feature item name and use the value to specify the wildcard. Here is an example:

```
     COMPLEMENTARY_GLOB[dev-pkgs] = '*-dev'

```

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">CONFFILES[¶][2229]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Identifies editable or configurable files that are part of a package. If the Package Management System (PMS) is being used to update packages on the target system, it is possible that configuration files you have changed after the original installation and that you now want to remain unchanged are overwritten. In other words, editable files might exist in the package that you do not want reset as part of the package update process. You can use the `CONFFILES` variable to list the files in the package that you wish to prevent the PMS from overwriting during this update process.

To use the `CONFFILES` variable, provide a package name override that identifies the resulting package. Then, provide a space-separated list of files. Here is an example:

```
     CONFFILES_${PN} += "${sysconfdir}/file1 \
        ${sysconfdir}/file2 ${sysconfdir}/file3"

```

A relationship exists between the `CONFFILES` and `[FILES][1487]` variables. The files listed within `CONFFILES`must be a subset of the files listed within `FILES`. Because the configuration files you provide with `CONFFILES` are simply being identified so that the PMS will not overwrite them, it makes sense that the files must already be included as part of the package through the `FILES` variable.

### Note

When specifying paths as part of the `CONFFILES` variable, it is good practice to use appropriate path variables. For example, `${sysconfdir}` rather than `/etc` or `${bindir}` rather than `/usr/bin`. You can find a list of these variables at the top of the `meta/conf/bitbake.conf` file in the [Source Directory][2230].</dd>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Identifies the initial RAM filesystem (initramfs) source files. The OpenEmbedded build system receives and uses this kernel Kconfig variable as an environment variable. By default, the variable is set to null ("").

The `CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE` can be either a single cpio archive with a `.cpio` suffix or a space-separated list of directories and files for building the initramfs image. A cpio archive should contain a filesystem archive to be used as an initramfs image. Directories should contain a filesystem layout to be included in the initramfs image. Files should contain entries according to the format described by the `usr/gen_init_cpio` program in the kernel tree.

If you specify multiple directories and files, the initramfs image will be the aggregate of all of them.

For information on creating an initramfs, see the "[Building an Initial RAM Filesystem (initramfs) Image][2232]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

It is an important distinction that `COREBASE` points to the parent of this layer and not the layer itself. Consider an example where you have cloned the Poky Git repository and retained the `poky` name for your local copy of the repository. In this case, `COREBASE` points to the `poky` folder because it is the parent directory of the `poky/meta` layer.

Lists files from the [`COREBASE`][2270] directory that should be copied other than the layers listed in the `bblayers.conf` file. The `COREBASE_FILES` variable exists for the purpose of copying metadata from the OpenEmbedded build system into the extensible SDK.

Explicitly listing files in `COREBASE` is needed because it typically contains build directories and other files that should not normally be copied into the extensible SDK. Consequently, the value of`COREBASE_FILES` is used in order to only copy the files that are actually needed.

The most common usage of this is variable is to set it to "-1" within a recipe for a development version of a piece of software. Using the variable in this way causes the stable version of the recipe to build by default in the absence of `[PREFERRED_VERSION][1491]` being used to build the development version.

The default CPU and Application Binary Interface (ABI) tunings (i.e. the "tune") used by the OpenEmbedded build system. The `DEFAULTTUNE` helps define [`TUNE_FEATURES`][2293].

The default tune is either implicitly or explicitly set by the machine ([`MACHINE`][2294]). However, you can override the setting using available tunes as defined with [`AVAILTUNES`][2295].

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Lists a recipe's build-time dependencies. These are dependencies on other recipes whose contents (e.g. headers and shared libraries) are needed by the recipe at build time.

As an example, consider a recipe `foo` that contains the following assignment:

```
     DEPENDS = "bar"

```

The practical effect of the previous assignment is that all files installed by bar will be available in the appropriate staging sysroot, given by the [`STAGING_DIR*`][2297] variables, by the time the [`do_configure`][2298]task for `foo` runs. This mechanism is implemented by having `do_configure` depend on the[`do_populate_sysroot`][2299] task of each recipe listed in `DEPENDS`, through a `[`[`deptask`][2300]`]` declaration in the[`base`][2301] class.

### Note

It seldom is necessary to reference, for example, `STAGING_DIR_HOST` explicitly. The standard classes and build-related variables are configured to automatically use the appropriate staging sysroots.

As another example, `DEPENDS` can also be used to add utilities that run on the build machine during the build. For example, a recipe that makes use of a code generator built by the recipe `codegen`might have the following:

```
     DEPENDS = "codegen-native"

```

For more information, see the [`native`][2302] class and the [`EXTRANATIVEPATH`][2303] variable.

### Notes

*   `DEPENDS` is a list of recipe names. Or, to be more precise, it is a list of[`PROVIDES`][2] names, which usually match recipe names. Putting a package name such as "foo-dev" in `DEPENDS` does not make sense. Use "foo" instead, as this will put files from all the packages that make up `foo`, which includes those from `foo-dev`, into the sysroot.

*   One recipe having another recipe in `DEPENDS` does not by itself add any runtime dependencies between the packages produced by the two recipes. However, as explained in the "[Automatically Added Runtime Dependencies][3]" section, runtime dependencies will often be added automatically, meaning`DEPENDS` alone is sufficient for most recipes.

*   Counterintuitively, `DEPENDS` is often necessary even for recipes that install precompiled components. For example, if `libfoo` is a precompiled library that links against `libbar`, then linking against `libfoo` requires both `libfoo` and `libbar` to be available in the sysroot. Without a `DEPENDS` from the recipe that installs `libfoo` to the recipe that installs `libbar`, other recipes might fail to link against `libfoo`.

For information on runtime dependencies, see the [`RDEPENDS`][2304] variable. You can also see the "[Tasks][2305]" and "[Dependencies][2306]" sections in the BitBake User Manual for additional information on tasks and dependencies.

     DEPLOY_DIR_IPK = "${DEPLOY_DIR}/ipk"

```

The [`package_ipk`][2327] class uses the `DEPLOY_DIR_IPK` variable to make sure the [`do_package_write_ipk`][2328]task writes IPK packages into the appropriate folder. For more information on how packaging works, see the "[Package Feeds][2329]" section.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Points to the area that the OpenEmbedded build system uses to place RPM packages that are ready to be used outside of the build system. This variable applies only when [`PACKAGE_CLASSES`][2331] contains "package_rpm".

The BitBake configuration file initially defines this variable as a sub-folder of [`DEPLOY_DIR`][2332]:

```
     DEPLOY_DIR_RPM = "${DEPLOY_DIR}/rpm"

```

The [`package_rpm`][2333] class uses the `DEPLOY_DIR_RPM` variable to make sure the [`do_package_write_rpm`][2334]task writes RPM packages into the appropriate folder. For more information on how packaging works, see the "[Package Feeds][2335]" section.

Points to the area that the OpenEmbedded build system uses to place tarballs that are ready to be used outside of the build system. This variable applies only when [`PACKAGE_CLASSES`][2337] contains "package_tar".

The BitBake configuration file initially defines this variable as a sub-folder of [`DEPLOY_DIR`][2338]:

```
     DEPLOY_DIR_TAR = "${DEPLOY_DIR}/tar"

```
     DEPLOYDIR = "${WORKDIR}/deploy-${PN}"

```

Recipes inheriting the `deploy` class should copy files to be deployed into `DEPLOYDIR`, and the class will take care of copying them into [`DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE`][2345] afterwards.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A 32-bit MBR disk signature used by `directdisk` images.

By default, the signature is set to an automatically generated random value that allows the OpenEmbedded build system to create a boot loader. You can override the signature in the image recipe by setting `DISK_SIGNATURE` to an 8-digit hex string. You might want to override`DISK_SIGNATURE` if you want the disk signature to remain constant between image builds.

When using Linux 3.8 or later, you can use `DISK_SIGNATURE` to specify the root by UUID to allow the kernel to locate the root device even if the device name changes due to differences in hardware configuration. By default, `ROOT_VM` is set as follows:

```
     ROOT_VM ?= "root=/dev/sda2"

```

However, you can change this to locate the root device using the disk signature instead:

```
     ROOT_VM = "root=PARTUUID=${DISK_SIGNATURE}-02"

```

As previously mentioned, it is possible to set the `DISK_SIGNATURE` variable in your `local.conf` file to a fixed value if you do not want `syslinux.cfg` changing for each build. You might find this useful when you want to upgrade the root filesystem on a device without having to recreate or modify the master boot record.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The short name of the distribution. This variable corresponds to a distribution configuration file whose root name is the same as the variable's argument and whose filename extension is `.conf`. For example, the distribution configuration file for the Poky distribution is named `poky.conf` and resides in the `meta-poky/conf/distro` directory of the [Source Directory][2350].

Within that `poky.conf` file, the `DISTRO` variable is set as follows:

```
     DISTRO = "poky"

```

Distribution configuration files are located in a `conf/distro` directory within the [Metadata][2351] that contains the distribution configuration. The value for `DISTRO` must not contain spaces, and is typically all lower-case.

### Note

If the `DISTRO` variable is blank, a set of default configurations are used, which are specified within `meta/conf/distro/defaultsetup.conf` also in the Source Directory.</dd>

This variable takes affect through`packagegroup-base` so the variable only really applies to the more full-featured images that include `packagegroup-base`. You can use this variable to keep distro policy out of generic images. As with all other distro variables, you set this variable in the distro `.conf` file.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The software support you want in your distribution for various features. You define your distribution features in the distribution configuration file.

In most cases, the presence or absence of a feature in `DISTRO_FEATURES` is translated to the appropriate option supplied to the configure script during the [`do_configure`][2356] task for recipes that optionally support the feature. For example, specifying "x11" in `DISTRO_FEATURES`, causes every piece of software built for the target that can optionally support X11 to have its X11 support enabled.

Two more examples are Bluetooth and NFS support. For a more complete list of features that ships with the Yocto Project and that you can provide with this variable, see the "[Distro Features][2357]" section.

A convenience variable that gives you the default list of distro features with the exception of any features specific to the C library (`libc`).

When creating a custom distribution, you might find it useful to be able to reuse the default[`DISTRO_FEATURES`][2363] options without the need to write out the full set. Here is an example that uses`DISTRO_FEATURES_DEFAULT` from a custom distro configuration file:

A colon-separated list of overrides specific to the current distribution. By default, this list includes the value of [`DISTRO`][2380].

You can extend `DISTROOVERRIDES` to add extra overrides that should apply to the distribution.

The underlying mechanism behind `DISTROOVERRIDES` is simply that it is included in the default value of [`OVERRIDES`][2381].

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The central download directory used by the build process to store downloads. By default, `DL_DIR`gets files suitable for mirroring for everything except Git repositories. If you want tarballs of Git repositories, use the [`BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS`][2383] variable.

You can set this directory by defining the `DL_DIR` variable in the `conf/local.conf` file. This directory is self-maintaining and you should not have to touch it. By default, the directory is `downloads` in the[Build Directory][2384].

```
     #DL_DIR ?= "${TOPDIR}/downloads"

```

To specify a different download directory, simply remove the comment from the line and provide your directory.

During a first build, the system downloads many different source code tarballs from various upstream projects. Downloading can take a while, particularly if your network connection is slow. Tarballs are all stored in the directory defined by `DL_DIR` and the build system looks there first to find source tarballs.

### Note

When wiping and rebuilding, you can preserve this directory to speed up this part of subsequent builds.

You can safely share this directory between multiple builds on the same development machine. For additional information on how the build process gets source files when working behind a firewall or proxy server, see this specific question in the "[FAQ][2385]" chapter. You can also refer to the "[Working Behind a Network Proxy][2386]" Wiki page.

When used with the [`report-error`][2395] class, specifies the path used for storing the debug files created by the [error reporting tool][2396], which allows you to submit build errors you encounter to a central database. By default, the value of this variable is `${`[`LOG_DIR`][2397]`}/error-report`.

You can set `ERR_REPORT_DIR` to the path you want the error reporting tool to store the debug files as follows in your `local.conf` file:

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Triggers the OpenEmbedded build system's shared libraries resolver to exclude an entire package when scanning for shared libraries.

### Note

The shared libraries resolver's functionality results in part from the internal function`package_do_shlibs`, which is part of the [`do_package`][2401] task. You should be aware that the shared libraries resolver might implicitly define some dependencies between packages.

The `EXCLUDE_FROM_SHLIBS` variable is similar to the [`PRIVATE_LIBS`][2402] variable, which excludes a package's particular libraries only and not the whole package.

Use the `EXCLUDE_FROM_SHLIBS` variable by setting it to "1" for a particular package:

```
     EXCLUDE_FROM_SHLIBS = "1"

```

Directs BitBake to exclude a recipe from world builds (i.e. `bitbake world`). During world builds, BitBake locates, parses and builds all recipes found in every layer exposed in the `bblayers.conf`configuration file.

To exclude a recipe from a world build using this variable, set the variable to "1" in the recipe.

### Note

Recipes added to `EXCLUDE_FROM_WORLD` may still be built during a world build in order to satisfy dependencies of other recipes. Adding a recipe to `EXCLUDE_FROM_WORLD` only ensures that the recipe is not explicitly added to the list of build targets in a world build.</dd>

Used with file and pathnames to create a prefix for a recipe's version based on the recipe's [`PE`][2405] value. If `PE` is set and greater than zero for a recipe, `EXTENDPE` becomes that value (e.g if `PE` is equal to "1" then `EXTENDPE` becomes "1_"). If a recipe's `PE` is not set (the default) or is equal to zero, `EXTENDPE`becomes "".

The full package version specification as it appears on the final packages produced by a recipe. The variable's value is normally used to fix a runtime dependency to the exact same version of another package in the same recipe:

```
     RDEPENDS_${PN}-additional-module = "${PN} (= ${EXTENDPKGV})"

```

The dependency relationships are intended to force the package manager to upgrade these types of packages in lock-step.

When set, the `EXTERNAL_KERNEL_TOOLS` variable indicates that these tools are not in the source tree.

When kernel tools are available in the tree, they are preferred over any externally installed tools. Setting the `EXTERNAL_KERNEL_TOOLS` variable tells the OpenEmbedded build system to prefer the installed external tools. See the [`kernel-yocto`][2409] class in `meta/classes` to see how the variable is used.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A list of additional features to include in an image. When listing more than one feature, separate them with a space.

Typically, you configure this variable in your `local.conf` file, which is found in the [Build Directory][2424]. Although you can use this variable from within a recipe, best practices dictate that you do not.

### Note

To enable primary features from within the image recipe, use the [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][2425]variable.

Here are some examples of features you can add:

```
"dbg-pkgs" - Adds -dbg packages for all installed packages
             including symbol information for debugging and
             profiling.

"debug-tweaks" - Makes an image suitable for debugging.
                 For example, allows root logins without
                 passwords and enables post-installation
                 logging. See the 'allow-empty-password'
                 and 'post-install-logging' features in
                 the "Image Features" section for
                 more information.

"dev-pkgs" - Adds -dev packages for all installed packages.
             This is useful if you want to develop against
             the libraries in the image.

"read-only-rootfs" - Creates an image whose root
                     filesystem is read-only. See the
                     "Creating a Read-Only Root Filesystem"
                     section in the Yocto Project
                     Development Manual for more
                     information

"tools-debug" - Adds debugging tools such as gdb and
                strace.

"tools-sdk" - Adds development tools such as gcc, make,
              pkgconfig and so forth.

"tools-testapps" - Adds useful testing tools such as
                   ts_print, aplay, arecord and so
                   forth.

```

A list of recipes to build that do not provide packages for installing into the root filesystem.

Sometimes a recipe is required to build the final image but is not needed in the root filesystem. You can use the `EXTRA_IMAGEDEPENDS` variable to list these recipes and thus specify the dependencies. A typical example is a required bootloader in a machine configuration.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Defines one or more packages to include in an image when a specific item is included in[`IMAGE_FEATURES`][2447]. When setting the value, `FEATURE_PACKAGES` should have the name of the feature item as an override. Here is an example:

```
     FEATURE_PACKAGES_widget = "package1 package2"

```

In this example, if "widget" were added to `IMAGE_FEATURES`,  _`package1`_  and  _`package2`_  would be included in the image.

### Note

Packages installed by features defined through `FEATURE_PACKAGES` are often package groups. While similarly named, you should not confuse the`FEATURE_PACKAGES` variable with package groups, which are discussed elsewhere in the documentation.</dd>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Points to the base URL of the server and location within the document-root that provides the metadata and packages required by OPKG to support runtime package management of IPK packages. You set this variable in your `local.conf` file.

Consider the following example:

```
     FEED_DEPLOYDIR_BASE_URI = "http://192.168.7.1/BOARD-dir"

```

This example assumes you are serving your packages over HTTP and your databases are located in a directory named `BOARD-dir`, which is underneath your HTTP server's document-root. In this case, the OpenEmbedded build system generates a set of configuration files for you in your target that work with the feed.

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">FILES[¶][2449]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The list of files and directories that are placed in a package. The [`PACKAGES`][2450] variable lists the packages generated by a recipe.

To use the `FILES` variable, provide a package name override that identifies the resulting package. Then, provide a space-separated list of files or paths that identify the files you want included as part of the resulting package. Here is an example:

```
     FILES_${PN} += "${bindir}/mydir1 ${bindir}/mydir2/myfile"

```

### Note

When specifying paths as part of the `FILES` variable, it is good practice to use appropriate path variables. For example, use `${sysconfdir}` rather than `/etc`, or`${bindir}` rather than `/usr/bin`. You can find a list of these variables at the top of the `meta/conf/bitbake.conf` file in the [Source Directory][2451]. You will also find the default values of the various `FILES_*` variables in this file.

If some of the files you provide with the `FILES` variable are editable and you know they should not be overwritten during the package update process by the Package Management System (PMS), you can identify these files so that the PMS will not overwrite them. See the [`CONFFILES`][2452] variable for information on how to identify these files to the PMS.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Defines the file specification to match [`SOLIBSDEV`][2454]. In other words, `FILES_SOLIBSDEV` defines the full path name of the development symbolic link (symlink) for shared libraries on the target platform.

The following statement from the `bitbake.conf` shows how it is set:

```
     FILES_SOLIBSDEV ?= "${base_libdir}/lib*${SOLIBSDEV} ${libdir}/lib*${SOLIBSDEV}"

```

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Extends the search path the OpenEmbedded build system uses when looking for files and patches as it processes recipes and append files. The default directories BitBake uses when it processes recipes are initially defined by the [`FILESPATH`][2456] variable. You can extend `FILESPATH` variable by using `FILESEXTRAPATHS`.

Best practices dictate that you accomplish this by using `FILESEXTRAPATHS` from within a `.bbappend`file and that you prepend paths as follows:

```
     FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/${PN}:"

```

In the above example, the build system first looks for files in a directory that has the same name as the corresponding append file.

### Note

When extending `FILESEXTRAPATHS`, be sure to use the immediate expansion (`:=`) operator. Immediate expansion makes sure that BitBake evaluates [`THISDIR`][1499] at the time the directive is encountered rather than at some later time when expansion might result in a directory that does not contain the files you need.

Also, include the trailing separating colon character if you are prepending. The trailing colon character is necessary because you are directing BitBake to extend the path by prepending directories to the search path.

Here is another common use:

```
     FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "${THISDIR}/files:"

```

In this example, the build system extends the `FILESPATH` variable to include a directory named `files` that is in the same directory as the corresponding append file.

Here is a final example that specifically adds three paths:

```
     FILESEXTRAPATHS_prepend := "path_1:path_2:path_3:"

```

By prepending paths in `.bbappend` files, you allow multiple append files that reside in different layers but are used for the same recipe to correctly extend the path.

A subset of [`OVERRIDES`][2458] used by the OpenEmbedded build system for creating [`FILESPATH`][2459]. You can find more information on how overrides are handled in the [BitBake Manual][2460].

By default, the `FILESOVERRIDES` variable is defined as:

```
     FILESOVERRIDES = "${TRANSLATED_TARGET_ARCH}:${MACHINEOVERRIDES}:${DISTROOVERRIDES}"

```

### Note

Do not hand-edit the `FILESOVERRIDES` variable. The values match up with expected overrides and are used in an expected manner by the build system.</dd>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The default set of directories the OpenEmbedded build system uses when searching for patches and files. During the build process, BitBake searches each directory in `FILESPATH` in the specified order when looking for files and patches specified by each `file://` URI in a recipe.

The default value for the `FILESPATH` variable is defined in the `base.bbclass` class found in `meta/classes` in the [Source Directory][2462]:

```
     FILESPATH = "${@base_set_filespath(["${FILE_DIRNAME}/${BP}", \
        "${FILE_DIRNAME}/${BPN}", "${FILE_DIRNAME}/files"], d)}"

```

### Note

Do not hand-edit the `FILESPATH` variable. If you want the build system to look in directories other than the defaults, extend the `FILESPATH` variable by using the[`FILESEXTRAPATHS`][2463] variable.

Be aware that the default `FILESPATH` directories do not map to directories in custom layers where append files (`.bbappend`) are used. If you want the build system to find patches or files that reside with your append files, you need to extend the `FILESPATH` variable by using the [`FILESEXTRAPATHS`][2464]variable.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Allows you to define your own file permissions settings table as part of your configuration for the packaging process. For example, suppose you need a consistent set of custom permissions for a set of groups and users across an entire work project. It is best to do this in the packages themselves but this is not always possible.

By default, the OpenEmbedded build system uses the `fs-perms.txt`, which is located in the `meta/files` folder in the [Source Directory][2466]. If you create your own file permissions setting table, you should place it in your layer or the distro's layer.

You define the `FILESYSTEM_PERMS_TABLES` variable in the `conf/local.conf` file, which is found in the [Build Directory][2467], to point to your custom `fs-perms.txt`. You can specify more than a single file permissions setting table. The paths you specify to these files must be defined within the [`BBPATH`][2468]variable.

For guidance on how to create your own file permissions settings table file, examine the existing `fs-perms.txt`.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Extra options passed to the `make` command during the [`do_compile`][2517] task that specify parallel compilation. This variable usually takes the form of "-j  _`x`_ ", where  _`x`_  represents the maximum number of parallel threads `make` can run.

### Note

The options passed affect builds on all enabled machines on the network, which are machines running the `iceccd` daemon.

If your enabled machines support multiple cores, coming up with the maximum number of parallel threads that gives you the best performance could take some experimentation since machine speed, network lag, available memory, and existing machine loads can all affect build time. Consequently, unlike the [`PARALLEL_MAKE`][2518] variable, there is no rule-of-thumb for setting`ICECC_PARALLEL_MAKE` to achieve optimal performance.

If you do not set `ICECC_PARALLEL_MAKE`, the build system does not use it (i.e. the system does not detect and assign the number of cores as is done with `PARALLEL_MAKE`).

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A space-separated list of files installed into the boot partition when preparing an image using the`wic` tool with the `bootimg-partition` source plugin. By default, the files are installed under the same name as the source files. To change the installed name, separate it from the original name with a semi-colon (;). Source files need to be located in [`DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE`][2531]. Here are two examples:

```
     IMAGE_BOOT_FILES = "u-boot.img uImage;kernel"
     IMAGE_BOOT_FILES = "u-boot.${UBOOT_SUFFIX} ${KERNEL_IMAGETYPE}"

```

Alternatively, source files can be picked up using a glob pattern. In this case, the destination file will have the same name as the base name of the source file path. To install files into a directory within the target location, pass its name after a semi-colon (;). Here are two examples:

```
     IMAGE_BOOT_FILES = "bcm2835-bootfiles/*"
     IMAGE_BOOT_FILES = "bcm2835-bootfiles/*;boot/"

```

The first example installs all files from `${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/bcm2835-bootfiles` into the root of the target partition. The second example installs the same files into a `boot` directory within the target partition.

A list of classes that all images should inherit. You typically use this variable to specify the list of classes that register the different types of images the OpenEmbedded build system creates.

The default value for `IMAGE_CLASSES` is `image_types`. You can set this variable in your `local.conf`or in a distribution configuration file.

For more information, see `meta/classes/image_types.bbclass` in the [Source Directory][2533].

Specifies the command to create the image file for a specific image type, which corresponds to the value set set in [`IMAGE_FSTYPES`][2535], (e.g. `ext3`, `btrfs`, and so forth). When setting this variable, you should use an override for the associated type. Here is an example:

```
     IMAGE_CMD_jffs2 = "mkfs.jffs2 --root=${IMAGE_ROOTFS} \
        --faketime --output=${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/${IMAGE_NAME}.rootfs.jffs2 \

These files list basic device nodes that should be created under `/dev` within the image. If `IMAGE_DEVICE_TABLES` is not set, `files/device_table-minimal.txt` is used, which is located by [`BBPATH`][2538]. For details on how you should write device table files, see `meta/files/device_table-minimal.txt` as an example.

The primary list of features to include in an image. Typically, you configure this variable in an image recipe. Although you can use this variable from your `local.conf` file, which is found in the [Build Directory][2540], best practices dictate that you do not.

### Note

To enable extra features from outside the image recipe, use the`[EXTRA_IMAGE_FEATURES][1502]` variable.

For a list of image features that ships with the Yocto Project, see the "[Image Features][2541]" section.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the formats the OpenEmbedded build system uses during the build when creating the root filesystem. For example, setting `IMAGE_FSTYPES` as follows causes the build system to create root filesystems using two formats: `.ext3` and `.tar.bz2`:

```
     IMAGE_FSTYPES = "ext3 tar.bz2"

```

For the complete list of supported image formats from which you can choose, see [`IMAGE_TYPES`][2544].

### Note

If you add "live" to `IMAGE_FSTYPES` inside an image recipe, be sure that you do so prior to the "inherit image" line of the recipe or the live image will not build.

### Note

Due to the way this variable is processed, it is not possible to update its contents using `_append` or `_prepend`. To add one or more additional options to this variable the `+=` operator must be used.</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">IMAGE_INSTALL[¶][2545]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the packages to install into an image. The `IMAGE_INSTALL` variable is a mechanism for an image recipe and you should use it with care to avoid ordering issues.

### Note

When working with an [`core-image-minimal-initramfs`][2546] image, do not use the `IMAGE_INSTALL` variable to specify packages for installation. Instead, use the[`PACKAGE_INSTALL`][2547] variable, which allows the initial RAM filesystem (initramfs) recipe to use a fixed set of packages and not be affected by `IMAGE_INSTALL`. For information on creating an initramfs, see the "[Building an Initial RAM Filesystem (initramfs) Image][2548]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

Image recipes set `IMAGE_INSTALL` to specify the packages to install into an image through`image.bbclass`. Additionally, "helper" classes exist, such as `core-image.bbclass`, that can take`[IMAGE_FEATURES][1503]` lists and turn these into auto-generated entries in `IMAGE_INSTALL` in addition to its default contents.

Using `IMAGE_INSTALL` with the `+=` operator from the `/conf/local.conf` file or from within an image recipe is not recommended as it can cause ordering issues. Since `core-image.bbclass` sets`IMAGE_INSTALL` to a default value using the `?=` operator, using a `+=` operation against`IMAGE_INSTALL` will result in unexpected behavior when used in `conf/local.conf`. Furthermore, the same operation from within an image recipe may or may not succeed depending on the specific situation. In both these cases, the behavior is contrary to how most users expect the `+=` operator to work.

When you use this variable, it is best to use it as follows:

```
     IMAGE_INSTALL_append = " package-name"

```

Be sure to include the space between the quotation character and the start of the package name or names.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the list of locales to install into the image during the root filesystem construction process. The OpenEmbedded build system automatically splits locale files, which are used for localization, into separate packages. Setting the `IMAGE_LINGUAS` variable ensures that any locale packages that correspond to packages already selected for installation into the image are also installed. Here is an example:

```
     IMAGE_LINGUAS = "pt-br de-de"

```

In this example, the build system ensures any Brazilian Portuguese and German locale files that correspond to packages in the image are installed (i.e. `*-locale-pt-br` and `*-locale-de-de` as well as `*-locale-pt` and `*-locale-de`, since some software packages only provide locale files by language and not by country-specific language).

See the [`GLIBC_GENERATE_LOCALES`][2550] variable for information on generating GLIBC locales.

The manifest file for the image. This file lists all the installed packages that make up the image. The file contains package information on a line-per-package basis as follows:

```
     packagename packagearch version

```

The [`image`][2552] class defines the manifest file as follows:

```
     IMAGE_MANIFEST = "${DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE}/${IMAGE_NAME}.rootfs.manifest"

```

The location is derived using the [`DEPLOY_DIR_IMAGE`][2553] and [`IMAGE_NAME`][2554] variables. You can find information on how the image is created in the "[Image Generation][2555]" section.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Defines a multiplier that the build system applies to the initial image size for cases when the multiplier times the returned disk usage value for the image is greater than the sum of`[IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE][1504]` and `[IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE][1505]`. The result of the multiplier applied to the initial image size creates free disk space in the image as overhead. By default, the build process uses a multiplier of 1.3 for this variable. This default value results in 30% free disk space added to the image when this method is used to determine the final generated image size. You should be aware that post install scripts and the package management system uses disk space inside this overhead area. Consequently, the multiplier does not produce an image with all the theoretical free disk space. See `[IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE][1506]` for information on how the build system determines the overall image size.

The default 30% free disk space typically gives the image enough room to boot and allows for basic post installs while still leaving a small amount of free disk space. If 30% free space is inadequate, you can increase the default value. For example, the following setting gives you 50% free space added to the image:

```
     IMAGE_OVERHEAD_FACTOR = "1.5"

```

Alternatively, you can ensure a specific amount of free disk space is added to the image by using the `[IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE][1507]` variable.

### Warning

The `package_tar` class is broken and is not supported. It is recommended that you do not use it.

The [`populate_sdk_*`][2566] and [`image`][2567] classes use the `IMAGE_PKGTYPE` for packaging up images and SDKs.

You should not set the `IMAGE_PKGTYPE` manually. Rather, the variable is set indirectly through the appropriate [`package_*`][2568] class using the [`PACKAGE_CLASSES`][2569] variable. The OpenEmbedded build system uses the first package type (e.g. DEB, RPM, or IPK) that appears with the variable

### Note

Files using the `.tar` format are never used as a substitute packaging format for DEB, RPM, and IPK formatted files for your image or SDK.</dd>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Defines additional free disk space created in the image in Kbytes. By default, this variable is set to "0". This free disk space is added to the image after the build system determines the image size as described in `[IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE][1508]`.

This variable is particularly useful when you want to ensure that a specific amount of free disk space is available on a device after an image is installed and running. For example, to be sure 5 Gbytes of free disk space is available, set the variable as follows:

```
     IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE = "5242880"

For example, the Yocto Project Build Appliance specifically requests 40 Gbytes of extra space with the line:

```

Defines the size in Kbytes for the generated image. The OpenEmbedded build system determines the final size for the generated image using an algorithm that takes into account the initial disk space used for the generated image, a requested size for the image, and requested additional free disk space to be added to the image. Programatically, the build system determines the final size of the generated image as follows:

```
    if (image-du * overhead) < rootfs-size:
	internal-rootfs-size = rootfs-size + xspace
    else:
	internal-rootfs-size = (image-du * overhead) + xspace

    where:

      image-du = Returned value of the du command on
                 the image.

      overhead = IMAGE_OVERHEAD_FACTOR

      rootfs-size = IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE

      internal-rootfs-size = Initial root filesystem
                             size before any modifications.

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">INC_PR[¶][2587]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Helps define the recipe revision for recipes that share a common `include` file. You can think of this variable as part of the recipe revision as set from within an include file.

Suppose, for example, you have a set of recipes that are used across several projects. And, within each of those recipes the revision (its [`PR`][2588] value) is set accordingly. In this case, when the revision of those recipes changes, the burden is on you to find all those recipes and be sure that they get changed to reflect the updated version of the recipe. In this scenario, it can get complicated when recipes that are used in many places and provide common functionality are upgraded to a new revision.

A more efficient way of dealing with this situation is to set the `INC_PR` variable inside the `include`files that the recipes share and then expand the `INC_PR` variable within the recipes to help define the recipe revision.

The following provides an example that shows how to use the `INC_PR` variable given a common `include` file that defines the variable. Once the variable is defined in the `include` file, you can use the variable to set the `PR` values in each recipe. You will notice that when you set a recipe's `PR` you can provide more granular revisioning by appending values to the `INC_PR` variable:

```
recipes-graphics/xorg-font/xorg-font-common.inc:INC_PR = "r2"
recipes-graphics/xorg-font/encodings_1.0.4.bb:PR = "${INC_PR}.1"
recipes-graphics/xorg-font/font-util_1.3.0.bb:PR = "${INC_PR}.0"
recipes-graphics/xorg-font/font-alias_1.0.3.bb:PR = "${INC_PR}.3"

```

The first line of the example establishes the baseline revision to be used for all recipes that use the`include` file. The remaining lines in the example are from individual recipes and show how the `PR`value is set.

Prevents the default dependencies, namely the C compiler and standard C library (libc), from being added to [`DEPENDS`][2595]. This variable is usually used within recipes that do not require any compilation using the C compiler.

Set the variable to "1" to prevent the default dependencies from being added.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Prevents the OpenEmbedded build system from splitting out debug information during packaging. By default, the build system splits out debugging information during the [`do_package`][2597] task. For more information on how debug information is split out, see the [`PACKAGE_DEBUG_SPLIT_STYLE`][2598] variable.

To prevent the build system from splitting out debug information during packaging, set the`INHIBIT_PACKAGE_DEBUG_SPLIT` variable as follows:

```
     INHIBIT_PACKAGE_DEBUG_SPLIT = "1"

```

If set to "1", causes the build to not strip binaries in resulting packages and prevents the `-dbg`package from containing the source files.

By default, the OpenEmbedded build system strips binaries and puts the debugging symbols into`${`[`PN`][2600]`}-dbg`. Consequently, you should not set `INHIBIT_PACKAGE_STRIP` when you plan to debug in general.

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">INITRAMFS_FSTYPES[¶][2601]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Defines the format for the output image of an initial RAM filesystem (initramfs), which is used during boot. Supported formats are the same as those supported by the [`IMAGE_FSTYPES`][2602] variable.

The default value of this variable, which is set in the `meta/conf/bitbake.conf` configuration file in the [Source Directory][2603], is "cpio.gz". The Linux kernel's initramfs mechanism, as opposed to the initial RAM filesystem [initrd][2604] mechanism, expects an optionally compressed cpio archive.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">INITRAMFS_IMAGE[¶][2605]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the [`PROVIDES`][2606] name of an image recipe that is used to build an initial RAM filesystem (initramfs) image. An initramfs provides a temporary root filesystem used for early system initialization (e.g. loading of modules needed to locate and mount the "real" root filesystem). The specified recipe is added as a dependency of the root filesystem recipe (e.g. `core-image-sato`). See the `meta/recipes-core/images/core-image-minimal-initramfs.bb` recipe in the [Source Directory][2607] for an example initramfs recipe. To select this recipe to provide the initramfs, set `INITRAMFS_IMAGE` to "core-image-minimal-initramfs".

### Note

The initramfs image recipe should set [`IMAGE_FSTYPES`][2608] to [`INITRAMFS_FSTYPES`][2609].

You can also find more information by referencing the`meta/poky/conf/local.conf.sample.extended` configuration file in the [Source Directory][2610], the[`image`][2611] class, and the [`kernel`][2612] class to see how to use the `INITRAMFS_IMAGE` variable.

If `INITRAMFS_IMAGE` is empty, which is the default, then no initramfs is built.

For more information, you can also see the [`INITRAMFS_IMAGE_BUNDLE`][2613] variable, which allows the generated image to be bundled inside the kernel image. Additionally, for information on creating an initramfs, see the "[Building an Initial RAM Filesystem (initramfs) Image][2614]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">INITRAMFS_IMAGE_BUNDLE[¶][2615]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Controls whether or not the image recipe specified by [`INITRAMFS_IMAGE`][2616] is run through an extra pass ([`do_bundle_initramfs`][2617]) during kernel compilation in order to build a single binary that contains both the kernel image and the initial RAM filesystem (initramfs) image. This makes use of the [`CONFIG_INITRAMFS_SOURCE`][2618] kernel feature.

### Note

Using an extra compilation pass to bundle the initramfs avoids a circular dependency between the kernel recipe and the initramfs recipe should the initramfs include kernel modules. Should that be the case, the initramfs recipe depends on the kernel for the kernel modules, and the kernel depends on the initramfs recipe since the initramfs is bundled inside the kernel image.

The combined binary is deposited into the `tmp/deploy` directory, which is part of the [Build Directory][2619].

Setting the variable to "1" in a configuration file causes the OpenEmbedded build system to generate a kernel image with the initramfs specified in [`INITRAMFS_IMAGE`][2620] bundled within:

```
     INITRAMFS_IMAGE_BUNDLE = "1"

```

By default, the [`kernel`][2621] class sets this variable to a null string as follows:

```
     INITRAMFS_IMAGE_BUNDLE ?= ""

```

### Note

You must set the `INITRAMFS_IMAGE_BUNDLE` variable in a configuration file. You cannot set the variable in a recipe file.

See the [`local.conf.sample.extended`][2622] file for additional information. Also, for information on creating an initramfs, see the "[Building an Initial RAM Filesystem (initramfs) Image][2623]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A regular expression used by the build process to explicitly identify the kernel branch that is validated, patched, and configured during a build. You must set this variable to ensure the exact kernel branch you want is being used by the build process.

Values for this variable are set in the kernel's recipe file and the kernel's append file. For example, if you are using the Yocto Project kernel that is based on the Linux 3.14 kernel, the kernel recipe file is the `meta/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto_3.14.bb` file. Following is an example for a kernel recipe file:

```
     KBRANCH ?= "standard/base"

```

This variable is also used from the kernel's append file to identify the kernel branch specific to a particular machine or target hardware. The kernel's append file is located in the BSP layer for a given machine. For example, the kernel append file for the Emenlow BSP is in the `meta-intel` Git repository and is named `meta-emenlow/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto_3.14.bbappend`. Here are the related statements from the append file:

```
     COMPATIBLE_MACHINE_emenlow-noemgd = "emenlow-noemgd"
     KMACHINE_emenlow-noemgd = "emenlow"
     KBRANCH_emenlow-noemgd = "standard/base"
     KERNEL_FEATURES_append_emenlow-noemgd = " features/drm-gma500/drm-gma500.scc"

```

The `KBRANCH` statement identifies the kernel branch to use when building for the Emenlow BSP.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When used with the [`kernel-yocto`][2643] class, specifies an "in-tree" kernel configuration file for use during a kernel build.

Typically, when using a `defconfig` to configure a kernel during a build, you place the file in your layer in the same manner as you would patch files and configuration fragment files (i.e. "out-of-tree"). However, if you want to use a `defconfig` file that is part of the kernel tree (i.e. "in-tree"), you can use the `KBUILD_DEFCONFIG` variable to point to the `defconfig` file.

To use the variable, set it in the append file for your kernel recipe using the following form:

```
     KBUILD_DEFCONFIG_KMACHINE ?= defconfig_file

```

Here is an example from a "raspberrypi2" `KMACHINE` build that uses a `defconfig` file named "bcm2709_defconfig":

```
     KBUILD_DEFCONFIG_raspberrypi2 = "bcm2709_defconfig"

```

As an alternative, you can use the following within your append file:

```
     KBUILD_DEFCONFIG_pn-linux-yocto ?= defconfig_file

```

For more information on how to use the `KBUILD_DEFCONFIG` variable, see the "[Using an "In-Tree" `defconfig` File][2645]" section.

A list of classes defining kernel image types that the [`kernel`][2649] class should inherit. You typically append this variable to enable extended image types. An example is the "kernel-fitimage", which enables fitImage support and resides in `meta/classes/kernel-fitimage.bbclass`. You can register custom kernel image types with the `kernel` class using this variable.

Specifies the name of the generated Linux kernel device tree (i.e. the `.dtb`) file.

### Note

Legacy support exists for specifying the full path to the device tree. However, providing just the `.dtb` file is preferred.

In order to use this variable, you must have the include files in your kernel recipe:

```
     require recipes-kernel/linux/linux-dtb.inc

Includes additional metadata from the Yocto Project kernel Git repository. In the OpenEmbedded build system, the default Board Support Packages (BSPs) [Metadata][2653] is provided through the [`KMACHINE`][2654] and [`KBRANCH`][2655] variables. You can use the `KERNEL_FEATURES` variable to further add metadata for all BSPs.

The metadata you add through this variable includes config fragments and features descriptions, which usually includes patches as well as config fragments. You typically override the `KERNEL_FEATURES` variable for a specific machine. In this way, you can provide validated, but optional, sets of kernel configurations and features.

For example, the following adds `netfilter` to all the Yocto Project kernels and adds sound support to the `qemux86` machine:

```
     # Add netfilter to all linux-yocto kernels
     KERNEL_FEATURES="features/netfilter/netfilter.scc"

     # Add sound support to the qemux86 machine

Specifies the maximum size of the kernel image file in kilobytes. If `KERNEL_IMAGE_MAXSIZE` is set, the size of the kernel image file is checked against the set value during the [`do_sizecheck`][2664] task. The task fails if the kernel image file is larger than the setting.

`KERNEL_IMAGE_MAXSIZE` is useful for target devices that have a limited amount of space in which the kernel image must be stored.

By default, this variable is not set, which means the size of the kernel image is not checked.

Lists kernel modules that need to be auto-loaded during boot.

### Note

This variable replaces the deprecated [`module_autoload`][2668] variable.

You can use the `KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD` variable anywhere that it can be recognized by the kernel recipe or by an out-of-tree kernel module recipe (e.g. a machine configuration file, a distribution configuration file, an append file for the recipe, or the recipe itself).

Specify it as follows:

```
     KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD += "module_name1 module_name2 module_name3"

```

Including `KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD` causes the OpenEmbedded build system to populate the`/etc/modules-load.d/modname.conf` file with the list of modules to be auto-loaded on boot. The modules appear one-per-line in the file. Here is an example of the most common use case:

```
     KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD += "module_name"

```

For information on how to populate the `modname.conf` file with `modprobe.d` syntax lines, see the[`KERNEL_MODULE_PROBECONF`][2669] variable.

To help maximize compatibility with out-of-tree drivers used to build modules, the OpenEmbedded build system also recognizes and uses the [`KERNEL_SRC`][2676] variable, which is identical to the`KERNEL_PATH` variable. Both variables are common variables used by external Makefiles to point to the kernel source directory.

Specifies whether the data referenced through [`PKGDATA_DIR`][2684] is needed or not. The `KERNELDEPMODDEPEND` does not control whether or not that data exists, but simply whether or not it is used. If you do not need to use the data, set the `KERNELDEPMODDEPEND` variable in your `initramfs`recipe. Setting the variable there when the data is not needed avoids a potential dependency loop.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The machine as known by the kernel. Sometimes the machine name used by the kernel does not match the machine name used by the OpenEmbedded build system. For example, the machine name that the OpenEmbedded build system understands as `core2-32-intel-common` goes by a different name in the Linux Yocto kernel. The kernel understands that machine as `intel-core2-32`. For cases like these, the `KMACHINE` variable maps the kernel machine name to the OpenEmbedded build system machine name.

These mappings between different names occur in the Yocto Linux Kernel's `meta` branch. As an example take a look in the `common/recipes-kernel/linux/linux-yocto_3.19.bbappend` file:

```
     LINUX_VERSION_core2-32-intel-common = "3.19.0"

The list of source licenses for the recipe. Follow these rules:

*   Do not use spaces within individual license names.

*   Separate license names using | (pipe) when there is a choice between licenses.

*   Separate license names using & (ampersand) when multiple licenses exist that cover different parts of the source.

*   You can use spaces between license names.

*   For standard licenses, use the names of the files in `meta/files/common-licenses/` or the[`SPDXLICENSEMAP`][81] flag names defined in `meta/conf/licenses.conf`.

Here are some examples:

```
     LICENSE = "LGPLv2.1 | GPLv3"
     LICENSE = "MPL-1 & LGPLv2.1"
     LICENSE = "GPLv2+"

```

The first example is from the recipes for Qt, which the user may choose to distribute under either the LGPL version 2.1 or GPL version 3\. The second example is from Cairo where two licenses cover different parts of the source code. The final example is from `sysstat`, which presents a single license.

You can also specify licenses on a per-package basis to handle situations where components of the output have different licenses. For example, a piece of software whose code is licensed under GPLv2 but has accompanying documentation licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License 1.2 could be specified as follows:

```
     LICENSE = "GFDL-1.2 & GPLv2"
     LICENSE_${PN} = "GPLv2"
     LICENSE_${PN}-doc = "GFDL-1.2"

Setting `LICENSE_CREATE_PACKAGE` to "1" causes the OpenEmbedded build system to create an extra package (i.e. `${`[`PN`][2708]`}-lic`) for each recipe and to add those packages to the [`RRECOMMENDS`][2709]`_${PN}`.

The `${PN}-lic` package installs a directory in `/usr/share/licenses` named `${PN}`, which is the recipe's base name, and installs files in that directory that contain license and copyright information (i.e. copies of the appropriate license files from `meta/common-licenses` that match the licenses specified in the [`LICENSE`][2710] variable of the recipe metadata and copies of files marked in[`LIC_FILES_CHKSUM`][2711] as containing license text).

For related information on providing license text, see the [`COPY_LIC_DIRS`][2712] variable, the[`COPY_LIC_MANIFEST`][2713] variable, and the "[Providing License Text][2714]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

If you do not specify a `LINUX_KERNEL_TYPE`, it defaults to "standard". Together with [`KMACHINE`][2725], the `LINUX_KERNEL_TYPE` variable defines the search arguments used by the kernel tools to find the appropriate description within the kernel [Metadata][2726] with which to build out the sources and configuration.

The Linux version from `kernel.org` on which the Linux kernel image being built using the OpenEmbedded build system is based. You define this variable in the kernel recipe. For example, the `linux-yocto-3.4.bb` kernel recipe found in `meta/recipes-kernel/linux` defines the variables as follows:

```
     LINUX_VERSION ?= "3.4.24"

A string extension compiled into the version string of the Linux kernel built with the OpenEmbedded build system. You define this variable in the kernel recipe. For example, the linux-yocto kernel recipes all define the variable as follows:

```
     LINUX_VERSION_EXTENSION ?= "-yocto-${LINUX_KERNEL_TYPE}"

```

Defining this variable essentially sets the Linux kernel configuration item `CONFIG_LOCALVERSION`, which is visible through the `uname` command. Here is an example that shows the extension assuming it was set as previously shown:

```
     $ uname -r
     3.7.0-rc8-custom

Specifies the target device for which the image is built. You define `MACHINE` in the `local.conf` file found in the [Build Directory][2734]. By default, `MACHINE` is set to "qemux86", which is an x86-based architecture machine to be emulated using QEMU:

```
     MACHINE ?= "qemux86"

```

The variable corresponds to a machine configuration file of the same name, through which machine-specific configurations are set. Thus, when `MACHINE` is set to "qemux86" there exists the corresponding `qemux86.conf` machine configuration file, which can be found in the [Source Directory][2735]in `meta/conf/machine`.

The list of machines supported by the Yocto Project as shipped include the following:

```
     MACHINE ?= "qemuarm"
     MACHINE ?= "qemuarm64"
     MACHINE ?= "qemumips"
     MACHINE ?= "qemumips64"

A list of required machine-specific packages to install as part of the image being built. The build process depends on these packages being present. Furthermore, because this is a "machine essential" variable, the list of packages are essential for the machine to boot. The impact of this variable affects images based on `packagegroup-core-boot`, including the `core-image-minimal`image.

This variable is similar to the `[MACHINE_ESSENTIAL_EXTRA_RRECOMMENDS][1509]` variable with the exception that the image being built has a build dependency on the variable's list of packages. In other words, the image will not build if a file in this list is not found.

As an example, suppose the machine for which you are building requires `example-init` to be run during boot to initialize the hardware. In this case, you would use the following in the machine's`.conf` configuration file:

```
     MACHINE_ESSENTIAL_EXTRA_RDEPENDS += "example-init"

```

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">MACHINE_ESSENTIAL_EXTRA_RRECOMMENDS[¶][2740]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A list of recommended machine-specific packages to install as part of the image being built. The build process does not depend on these packages being present. However, because this is a "machine essential" variable, the list of packages are essential for the machine to boot. The impact of this variable affects images based on `packagegroup-core-boot`, including the `core-image-minimal` image.

This variable is similar to the `[MACHINE_ESSENTIAL_EXTRA_RDEPENDS][1510]` variable with the exception that the image being built does not have a build dependency on the variable's list of packages. In other words, the image will still build if a package in this list is not found. Typically, this variable is used to handle essential kernel modules, whose functionality may be selected to be built into the kernel rather than as a module, in which case a package will not be produced.

Consider an example where you have a custom kernel where a specific touchscreen driver is required for the machine to be usable. However, the driver can be built as a module or into the kernel depending on the kernel configuration. If the driver is built as a module, you want it to be installed. But, when the driver is built into the kernel, you still want the build to succeed. This variable sets up a "recommends" relationship so that in the latter case, the build will not fail due to the missing package. To accomplish this, assuming the package for the module was called `kernel-module-ab123`, you would use the following in the machine's `.conf` configuration file:

```
     MACHINE_ESSENTIAL_EXTRA_RRECOMMENDS += "kernel-module-ab123"

```

### Note

In this example, the `kernel-module-ab123` recipe needs to explicitly set its[`PACKAGES`][2741] variable to ensure that BitBake does not use the kernel recipe's[`PACKAGES_DYNAMIC`][2742] variable to satisfy the dependency.

Some examples of these machine essentials are flash, screen, keyboard, mouse, or touchscreen drivers (depending on the machine).

A list of machine-specific packages to install as part of the image being built that are not essential for the machine to boot. However, the build process for more fully-featured images depends on the packages being present.

This variable affects all images based on `packagegroup-base`, which does not include the `core-image-minimal` or `core-image-full-cmdline` images.

The variable is similar to the `[MACHINE_EXTRA_RRECOMMENDS][1511]` variable with the exception that the image being built has a build dependency on the variable's list of packages. In other words, the image will not build if a file in this list is not found.

An example is a machine that has WiFi capability but is not essential for the machine to boot the image. However, if you are building a more fully-featured image, you want to enable the WiFi. The package containing the firmware for the WiFi hardware is always expected to exist, so it is acceptable for the build process to depend upon finding the package. In this case, assuming the package for the firmware was called `wifidriver-firmware`, you would use the following in the`.conf` file for the machine:

```
     MACHINE_EXTRA_RDEPENDS += "wifidriver-firmware"

A colon-separated list of overrides that apply to the current machine. By default, this list includes the value of [`MACHINE`][2756].

You can extend `MACHINEOVERRIDES` to add extra overrides that should apply to a machine. For example, all machines emulated in QEMU (e.g. `qemuarm`, `qemux86`, and so forth) include a file named`meta/conf/machine/include/qemu.inc` that prepends the following override to `MACHINEOVERRIDES`:

```
     MACHINEOVERRIDES =. "qemuall:"

```

This override allows variables to be overriden for all machines emulated in QEMU, like in the following example from the `connman-conf` recipe:

```
     SRC_URI_append_qemuall = "file://wired.config \
                               file://wired-setup \
                              "

Specifies a prefix has been added to [`PN`][2763] to create a special version of a recipe or package, such as a Multilib version. The variable is used in places where the prefix needs to be added to or removed from a the name (e.g. the [`BPN`][2764] variable). `MLPREFIX` gets set when a prefix has been added to `PN`.

### Note

The "ML" in `MLPREFIX` stands for "MultiLib". This representation is historical and comes from a time when `nativesdk` was a suffix rather than a prefix on the recipe name. When `nativesdk` was turned into a prefix, it made sense to set `MLPREFIX` for it as well.

To help understand when `MLPREFIX` might be needed, consider when [`BBCLASSEXTEND`][2765] is used to provide a `nativesdk` version of a recipe in addition to the target version. If that recipe declares build-time dependencies on tasks in other recipes by using [`DEPENDS`][2766], then a dependency on "foo" will automatically get rewritten to a dependency on "nativesdk-foo". However, dependencies like the following will not get rewritten automatically:

```

Specifies [`modprobe.d`][2770] syntax lines for inclusion in the `/etc/modprobe.d/modname.conf` file.

You can use this variable anywhere that it can be recognized by the kernel recipe or out-of-tree kernel module recipe (e.g. a machine configuration file, a distribution configuration file, an append file for the recipe, or the recipe itself). If you use this variable, you must also be sure to list the module name in the [`KERNEL_MODULE_AUTOLOAD`][2771] variable.

Here is the general syntax:

```
     module_conf_module_name = "modprobe.d-syntax"

```

You must use the kernel module name override.

Run `man modprobe.d` in the shell to find out more information on the exact syntax you want to provide with `module_conf`.

Including `module_conf` causes the OpenEmbedded build system to populate the`/etc/modprobe.d/modname.conf` file with `modprobe.d` syntax lines. Here is an example that adds the options `arg1` and `arg2` to a module named `mymodule`:

```
     module_conf_mymodule = "options mymodule arg1=val1 arg2=val2"

```

A string identifying the host distribution. Strings consist of the host distributor ID followed by the release, as reported by the `lsb_release` tool or as read from `/etc/lsb-release`. For example, when running a build on Ubuntu 12.10, the value is "Ubuntu-12.10". If this information is unable to be determined, the value resolves to "Unknown".

This variable is used by default to isolate native shared state packages for different distributions (e.g. to avoid problems with `glibc` version incompatibilities). Additionally, the variable is checked against [`SANITY_TESTED_DISTROS`][2786] if that variable is set.

Prevents installation of all "recommended-only" packages. Recommended-only packages are packages installed only through the [`RRECOMMENDS`][2789] variable). Setting the `NO_RECOMMENDATIONS`variable to "1" turns this feature on:

```
     NO_RECOMMENDATIONS = "1"

```

You can set this variable globally in your `local.conf` file or you can attach it to a specific image recipe by using the recipe name override:

```
     NO_RECOMMENDATIONS_pn-target_image = "1"

```

It is important to realize that if you choose to not install packages using this variable and some other packages are dependent on them (i.e. listed in a recipe's [`RDEPENDS`][2790] variable), the OpenEmbedded build system ignores your request and will install the packages to avoid dependency errors.

### Note

Some recommended packages might be required for certain system functionality, such as kernel modules. It is up to you to add packages with the [`IMAGE_INSTALL`][2791]variable.

Support for this variable exists only when using the IPK and RPM packaging backend. Support does not exist for DEB.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A colon-separated list of overrides that currently apply. Overrides are a BitBake mechanism that allows variables to be selectively overridden at the end of parsing. The set of overrides in `OVERRIDES`represents the "state" during building, which includes the current recipe being built, the machine for which it is being built, and so forth.

As an example, if the string "an-override" appears as an element in the colon-separated list in`OVERRIDES`, then the following assignment will override `FOO` with the value "overridden" at the end of parsing:

```
     FOO_an-override = "overridden"

```

See the "[Conditional Syntax (Overrides)][2813]" section in the BitBake User Manual for more information on the overrides mechanism.

The default value of `OVERRIDES` includes the values of the [`CLASSOVERRIDE`][2814], [`MACHINEOVERRIDES`][2815], and[`DISTROOVERRIDES`][2816] variables. Another important override included by default is `pn-${PN}`. This override allows variables to be set for a single recipe within configuration (`.conf`) files. Here is an example:

```
     FOO_pn-myrecipe = "myrecipe-specific value"

```

### Tip

The architecture of the resulting package or packages.

By default, the value of this variable is set to [`TUNE_PKGARCH`][2820] when building for the target,`BUILD_ARCH` when building for the build host and "${SDK_ARCH}-${SDKPKGSUFFIX}" when building for the SDK. However, if your recipe's output packages are built specific to the target machine rather than general for the architecture of the machine, you should set `PACKAGE_ARCH` to the value of[`MACHINE_ARCH`][2821] in the recipe as follows:

```
     PACKAGE_ARCH = "${MACHINE_ARCH}"

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

This variable, which is set in the `local.conf` configuration file found in the `conf` folder of the [Build Directory][2825], specifies the package manager the OpenEmbedded build system uses when packaging data.

You can provide one or more of the following arguments for the variable:

```
     PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_rpm package_deb package_ipk package_tar"

```

### Warning

While it is a legal option, the `package_tar` class is broken and is not supported. It is recommended that you do not use it.

The build system uses only the first argument in the list as the package manager when creating your image or SDK. However, packages will be created using any additional packaging classes you specify. For example, if you use the following in your `local.conf` file:

```
     PACKAGE_CLASSES ?= "package_ipk"

```

The OpenEmbedded build system uses the IPK package manager to create your image or SDK.

For information on packaging and build performance effects as a result of the package manager in use, see the "[`package.bbclass`][2826]" section.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Determines how to split up the binary and debug information when creating `*-dbg` packages to be used with the GNU Project Debugger (GDB).

With the `PACKAGE_DEBUG_SPLIT_STYLE` variable, you can control where debug information, which can include or exclude source files, is stored:

*   ".debug": Debug symbol files are placed next to the binary in a `.debug` directory on the target. For example, if a binary is installed into `/bin`, the corresponding debug symbol files are installed in `/bin/.debug`. Source files are placed in `/usr/src/debug`. This is the default behavior.

*   "debug-file-directory": Debug symbol files are placed under `/usr/lib/debug` on the target, and separated by the path from where the binary is installed. For example, if a binary is installed in`/bin`, the corresponding debug symbols are installed in `/usr/lib/debug/bin`. Source files are placed in `/usr/src/debug`.

*   "debug-without-src": The same behavior as ".debug" previously described with the exception that no source files are installed.

You can find out more about debugging using GDB by reading the "[Debugging With the GNU Project Debugger (GDB) Remotely][2828]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Prevents specific packages from being installed when you are installing complementary packages.

You might find that you want to prevent installing certain packages when you are installing complementary packages. For example, if you are using [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][2830] to install `dev-pkgs`, you might not want to install all packages from a particular multilib. If you find yourself in this situation, you can use the `PACKAGE_EXCLUDE_COMPLEMENTARY` variable to specify regular expressions to match the packages you want to exclude.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">PACKAGE_EXCLUDE[¶][2831]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Lists packages that should not be installed into an image. For example:

```
     PACKAGE_EXCLUDE = "package_name package_name package_name ..."

```

You can set this variable globally in your `local.conf` file or you can attach it to a specific image recipe by using the recipe name override:

```
     PACKAGE_EXCLUDE_pn-target_image = "package_name"

```

If you choose to not install a package using this variable and some other package is dependent on it (i.e. listed in a recipe's [`RDEPENDS`][2832] variable), the OpenEmbedded build system generates a fatal installation error. Because the build system halts the process with a fatal error, you can use the variable with an iterative development process to remove specific components from a system.

Support for this variable exists only when using the IPK and RPM packaging backend. Support does not exist for DEB.

See the [`NO_RECOMMENDATIONS`][2833] and the [`BAD_RECOMMENDATIONS`][2834] variables for related information.

Because the package manager controls actual installation of all packages, the list of packages passed using `PACKAGE_INSTALL` is not the final list of packages that are actually installed. This variable is internal to the image construction code. Consequently, in general, you should use the[`IMAGE_INSTALL`][2848] variable to specify packages for installation. The exception to this is when working with the [`core-image-minimal-initramfs`][2849] image. When working with an initial RAM filesystem (initramfs) image, use the `PACKAGE_INSTALL` variable. For information on creating an initramfs, see the "[Building an Initial RAM Filesystem (initramfs) Image][2850]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

Specifies a list of dependencies for post-installation and pre-installation scripts on native/cross tools. If your post-installation or pre-installation script can execute at rootfs creation time rather than on the target but depends on a native tool in order to execute, you need to list the tools in`PACKAGE_WRITE_DEPENDS`.

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">PACKAGECONFIG[¶][2856]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

This variable provides a means of enabling or disabling features of a recipe on a per-recipe basis.`PACKAGECONFIG` blocks are defined in recipes when you specify features and then arguments that define feature behaviors. Here is the basic block structure:

```
     PACKAGECONFIG ??= "f1 f2 f3 ..."
     PACKAGECONFIG[f1] = "--with-f1,--without-f1,build-deps-f1,rt-deps-f1"
     PACKAGECONFIG[f2] = "--with-f2,--without-f2,build-deps-f2,rt-deps-f2"
     PACKAGECONFIG[f3] = "--with-f3,--without-f3,build-deps-f3,rt-deps-f3"

```

The `PACKAGECONFIG` variable itself specifies a space-separated list of the features to enable. Following the features, you can determine the behavior of each feature by providing up to four order-dependent arguments, which are separated by commas. You can omit any argument you like but must retain the separating commas. The order is important and specifies the following:

1.  Extra arguments that should be added to the configure script argument list ([`EXTRA_OECONF`][82] or[`PACKAGECONFIG_CONFARGS`][83]) if the feature is enabled.

2.  Extra arguments that should be added to `EXTRA_OECONF` or `PACKAGECONFIG_CONFARGS` if the feature is disabled.

3.  Additional build dependencies ([`DEPENDS`][84]) that should be added if the feature is enabled.

4.  Additional runtime dependencies ([`RDEPENDS`][85]) that should be added if the feature is enabled.

Consider the following `PACKAGECONFIG` block taken from the `librsvg` recipe. In this example the feature is `croco`, which has three arguments that determine the feature's behavior.

```
     PACKAGECONFIG ??= "croco"
     PACKAGECONFIG[croco] = "--with-croco,--without-croco,libcroco"

```

The `--with-croco` and `libcroco` arguments apply only if the feature is enabled. In this case, `--with-croco` is added to the configure script argument list and `libcroco` is added to `[DEPENDS][1519]`. On the other hand, if the feature is disabled say through a `.bbappend` file in another layer, then the second argument `--without-croco` is added to the configure script rather than `--with-croco`.

The basic `PACKAGECONFIG` structure previously described holds true regardless of whether you are creating a block or changing a block. When creating a block, use the structure inside your recipe.

If you want to change an existing `PACKAGECONFIG` block, you can do so one of two ways:

*   _Append file:_  Create an append file named  _`recipename`_ `.bbappend` in your layer and override the value of `PACKAGECONFIG`. You can either completely override the variable:

    ```
         PACKAGECONFIG="f4 f5"

    ```

    Or, you can just append the variable:

    ```
         PACKAGECONFIG_append = " f4"

    ```

*   _Configuration file:_  This method is identical to changing the block through an append file except you edit your `local.conf` or  `_`mydistro`_ .conf` file. As with append files previously described, you can either completely override the variable:

    ```
         PACKAGECONFIG_pn-recipename="f4 f5"

    ```

    Or, you can just amend the variable:

    ```
         PACKAGECONFIG_append_pn-recipename = " f4"

    ```

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A space-separated list of configuration options generated from the [`PACKAGECONFIG`][2858] setting.

Classes such as [`autotools`][2859] and [`cmake`][2860] use `PACKAGECONFIG_CONFARGS` to pass [`PACKAGECONFIG`][2861]options to `configure` and `cmake`, respectively. If you are using `PACKAGECONFIG` but not a class that handles the `do_configure` task, then you need to use `PACKAGECONFIG_CONFARGS` appropriately.

For additional information, see the [`PACKAGECONFIG`][2862] variable.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

For recipes inheriting the [`packagegroup`][2864] class, setting `PACKAGEGROUP_DISABLE_COMPLEMENTARY` to "1" specifies that the normal complementary packages (i.e. `-dev`, `-dbg`, and so forth) should not be automatically created by the `packagegroup` recipe, which is the default behavior.

The list of packages to be created from the recipe. The default value is the following:

```
     ${PN}-dbg ${PN}-staticdev ${PN}-dev ${PN}-doc ${PN}-locale ${PACKAGE_BEFORE_PN} ${PN}

```

During packaging, the [`do_package`][2866] task goes through `PACKAGES` and uses the [`FILES`][2867] variable corresponding to each package to assign files to the package. If a file matches the `FILES` variable for more than one package in `PACKAGES`, it will be assigned to the earliest (leftmost) package.

Packages in the variable's list that are empty (i.e. where none of the patterns in `FILES_` _`pkg`_  match any files installed by the [`do_install`][2868] task) are not generated, unless generation is forced through the [`ALLOW_EMPTY`][2869] variable.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A promise that your recipe satisfies runtime dependencies for optional modules that are found in other recipes. `PACKAGES_DYNAMIC` does not actually satisfy the dependencies, it only states that they should be satisfied. For example, if a hard, runtime dependency ([`RDEPENDS`][2871]) of another package is satisfied at build time through the `PACKAGES_DYNAMIC` variable, but a package with the module name is never actually produced, then the other package will be broken. Thus, if you attempt to include that package in an image, you will get a dependency failure from the packaging system during the [`do_rootfs`][2872] task.

Typically, if there is a chance that such a situation can occur and the package that is not created is valid without the dependency being satisfied, then you should use [`RRECOMMENDS`][2873] (a soft runtime dependency) instead of `RDEPENDS`.

For an example of how to use the `PACKAGES_DYNAMIC` variable when you are splitting packages, see the "[Handling Optional Module Packaging][2874]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

Specifies a list of functions run to perform additional splitting of files into individual packages. Recipes can either prepend to this variable or prepend to the `populate_packages` function in order to perform additional package splitting. In either case, the function should set [`PACKAGES`][2876], [`FILES`][2877],[`RDEPENDS`][2878] and other packaging variables appropriately in order to perform the desired splitting.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Extra options passed to the `make` command during the [`do_compile`][2880] task in order to specify parallel compilation on the local build host. This variable is usually in the form "-j  _`x`_ ", where  _`x`_  represents the maximum number of parallel threads `make` can run.

### Caution

In order for `PARALLEL_MAKE` to be effective, `make` must be called with`${`[`EXTRA_OEMAKE`][2881]`}`. An easy way to ensure this is to use the `oe_runmake` function.

By default, the OpenEmbedded build system automatically sets this variable to be equal to the number of cores the build system uses.

### Note

If the software being built experiences dependency issues during the `do_compile`task that result in race conditions, you can clear the `PARALLEL_MAKE` variable within the recipe as a workaround. For information on addressing race conditions, see the "[Debugging Parallel Make Races][2882]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

For single socket systems (i.e. one CPU), you should not have to override this variable to gain optimal parallelism during builds. However, if you have very large systems that employ multiple physical CPUs, you might want to make sure the `PARALLEL_MAKE` variable is not set higher than "-j 20".

For more information on speeding up builds, see the "[Speeding Up the Build][2883]" section.

Extra options passed to the `make install` command during the [`do_install`][2885] task in order to specify parallel installation. This variable defaults to the value of [`PARALLEL_MAKE`][2886].

### Notes and Cautions

In order for `PARALLEL_MAKEINST` to be effective, `make` must be called with`${`[`EXTRA_OEMAKE`][1520]`}`. An easy way to ensure this is to use the `oe_runmake` function.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Determines the action to take when a patch fails. You can set this variable to one of two values: "noop" and "user".

The default value of "noop" causes the build to simply fail when the OpenEmbedded build system cannot successfully apply a patch. Setting the value to "user" causes the build system to launch a shell and places you in the right location so that you can manually resolve the conflicts.

Set this variable in your `local.conf` file.

The default utility used is "quilt" except for the quilt-native recipe itself. Because the quilt tool is not available at the time quilt-native is being patched, it uses "patch".

If you wish to use an alternative patching tool, set the variable in the recipe using one of the following:

```

Points to a shared, global-state directory that holds data generated during the packaging process. During the packaging process, the [`do_packagedata`][2905] task packages data for each recipe and installs it into this temporary, shared area. This directory defaults to the following, which you should not change:

```
     ${STAGING_DIR_HOST}/pkgdata

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

This variable can have two separate functions depending on the context: a recipe name or a resulting package name.

`PN` refers to a recipe name in the context of a file used by the OpenEmbedded build system as input to create a package. The name is normally extracted from the recipe file name. For example, if the recipe is named `expat_2.0.1.bb`, then the default value of `PN` will be "expat".

The variable refers to a package name in the context of a file created or produced by the OpenEmbedded build system.

If applicable, the `PN` variable also contains any special suffix or prefix. For example, using `bash` to build packages for the native machine, `PN` is `bash-native`. Using `bash` to build packages for the target and for Multilib, `PN` would be `bash` and `lib64-bash`, respectively.

Lists recipes you do not want the OpenEmbedded build system to build. This variable works in conjunction with the [`blacklist`][2922] class, which the recipe must inherit globally.

To prevent a recipe from being built, inherit the class globally and use the variable in your`local.conf` file. Here is an example that prevents `myrecipe` from being built:

```
     INHERIT += "blacklist"
     PNBLACKLIST[myrecipe] = "Not supported by our organization."

Specifies a list of functions to call once the OpenEmbedded build system has created the host part of the SDK. You can specify functions separated by semicolons:

```
     POPULATE_SDK_POST_HOST_COMMAND += "function; ... "

```

If you need to pass the SDK path to a command within a function, you can use `${SDK_DIR}`, which points to the parent directory used by the OpenEmbedded build system when creating SDK output. See the [`SDK_DIR`][2924] variable for more information.

</dd>

Specifies a list of functions to call once the OpenEmbedded build system has created the target part of the SDK. You can specify functions separated by semicolons:

```
     POPULATE_SDK_POST_TARGET_COMMAND += "function; ... "

```

If you need to pass the SDK path to a command within a function, you can use `${SDK_DIR}`, which points to the parent directory used by the OpenEmbedded build system when creating SDK output. See the [`SDK_DIR`][2926] variable for more information.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The revision of the recipe. The default value for this variable is "r0". Subsequent revisions of the recipe conventionally have the values "r1", "r2", and so forth. When [`PV`][2928] increases, `PR` is conventionally reset to "r0".

### Note

The OpenEmbedded build system does not need the aid of `PR` to know when to rebuild a recipe. The build system uses the task [input checksums][2929] along with the[stamp][2930] and [shared state cache][2931] mechanisms.

The `PR` variable primarily becomes significant when a package manager dynamically installs packages on an already built image. In this case, `PR`, which is the default value of [`PKGR`][2932], helps the package manager distinguish which package is the most recent one in cases where many packages have the same `PV` (i.e. `PKGV`). A component having many packages with the same `PV` usually means that the packages all install the same upstream version, but with later (`PR`) version packages including packaging fixes.

### Note

`PR` does not need to be increased for changes that do not change the package contents or metadata.

Because manually managing `PR` can be cumbersome and error-prone, an automated solution exists. See the "[Working With a PR Service][2933]" section for more information.

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">PREFERRED_PROVIDER[¶][2934]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

If multiple recipes provide an item, this variable determines which recipe should be given preference. You should always suffix the variable with the name of the provided item, and you should set it to the [`PN`][2935] of the recipe to which you want to give precedence. Some examples:

```
     PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/kernel ?= "linux-yocto"
     PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/xserver = "xserver-xf86"
     PREFERRED_PROVIDER_virtual/libgl ?= "mesa"

```

### Note

If you set `PREFERRED_PROVIDER` for a `virtual/*` item, then any recipe that[`PROVIDES`][2936] that item that is not selected by `PREFERRED_PROVIDER` is prevented from building, which is usually desirable since this mechanism is designed to select between mutually exclusive alternative providers.</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">PREFERRED_VERSION[¶][2937]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

If there are multiple versions of recipes available, this variable determines which recipe should be given preference. You must always suffix the variable with the [`PN`][2938] you want to select, and you should set the [`PV`][2939] accordingly for precedence. You can use the "`%`" character as a wildcard to match any number of characters, which can be useful when specifying versions that contain long revision numbers that could potentially change. Here are two examples:

```
     PREFERRED_VERSION_python = "3.4.0"
     PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto = "3.19%"

```

### Note

The specified version is matched against [`PV`][2940], which does not necessarily match the version part of the recipe's filename. For example, consider two recipes`foo_1.2.bb` and `foo_git.bb` where `foo_git.bb` contains the following assignment:
```
     PV = "1.1+git${SRCPV}"

```
In this case, the correct way to select `foo_git.bb` is by using an assignment such as the following:
```
     PREFERRED_VERSION_foo = "1.1+git%"

```
Compare that previous example against the following incorrect example, which does not work:
```
     PREFERRED_VERSION_foo = "git"

```

Sometimes the `PREFERRED_VERSION` variable can be set by configuration files in a way that is hard to change. You can use [`OVERRIDES`][2941] to set a machine-specific override. Here is an example:

```
     PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto_qemux86 = "3.4%"

```

Although not recommended, worst case, you can also use the "forcevariable" override, which is the strongest override possible. Here is an example:

```
     PREFERRED_VERSION_linux-yocto_forcevariable = "3.4%"

```

### Note

The `_forcevariable` override is not handled specially. This override only works because the default value of [`OVERRIDES`][2942] includes "forcevariable".</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">PREMIRRORS[¶][2943]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies additional paths from which the OpenEmbedded build system gets source code. When the build system searches for source code, it first tries the local download directory. If that location fails, the build system tries locations defined by `PREMIRRORS`, the upstream source, and then locations specified by [`MIRRORS`][2944] in that order.

Assuming your distribution ([`DISTRO`][2945]) is "poky", the default value for `PREMIRRORS` is defined in the`conf/distro/poky.conf` file in the `meta-poky` Git repository.

Typically, you could add a specific server for the build system to attempt before any others by adding something like the following to the `local.conf` configuration file in the [Build Directory][2946]:

```
     PREMIRRORS_prepend = "\
     git://.*/.* http://www.yoctoproject.org/sources/ \n \
     ftp://.*/.* http://www.yoctoproject.org/sources/ \n \
     http://.*/.* http://www.yoctoproject.org/sources/ \n \
     https://.*/.* http://www.yoctoproject.org/sources/ \n"

```

These changes cause the build system to intercept Git, FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS requests and direct them to the `http://` sources mirror. You can use `file://` URLs to point to local directories or network shares as well.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Indicates the importance of a package.

`PRIORITY` is considered to be part of the distribution policy because the importance of any given recipe depends on the purpose for which the distribution is being produced. Thus, `PRIORITY` is not normally set within recipes.

You can set `PRIORITY` to "required", "standard", "extra", and "optional", which is the default.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies libraries installed within a recipe that should be ignored by the OpenEmbedded build system's shared library resolver. This variable is typically used when software being built by a recipe has its own private versions of a library normally provided by another recipe. In this case, you would not want the package containing the private libraries to be set as a dependency on other unrelated packages that should instead depend on the package providing the standard version of the library.

Libraries specified in this variable should be specified by their file name. For example, from the Firefox recipe in meta-browser:

```
     PRIVATE_LIBS = "libmozjs.so \
                     libxpcom.so \
                     libnspr4.so \
                     libxul.so \
                     libmozalloc.so \
                     libplc4.so \
                     libplds4.so"

```

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">PROVIDES[¶][2950]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A list of aliases by which a particular recipe can be known. By default, a recipe's own `[PN][1522]` is implicitly already in its `PROVIDES` list. If a recipe uses `PROVIDES`, the additional aliases are synonyms for the recipe and can be useful satisfying dependencies of other recipes during the build as specified by`[DEPENDS][1523]`.

Consider the following example `PROVIDES` statement from a recipe file `libav_0.8.11.bb`:

```
     PROVIDES += "libpostproc"

```

The `PROVIDES` statement results in the "libav" recipe also being known as "libpostproc".

In addition to providing recipes under alternate names, the `PROVIDES` mechanism is also used to implement virtual targets. A virtual target is a name that corresponds to some particular functionality (e.g. a Linux kernel). Recipes that provide the functionality in question list the virtual target in `PROVIDES`. Recipes that depend on the functionality in question can include the virtual target in [`DEPENDS`][2951] to leave the choice of provider open.

Conventionally, virtual targets have names on the form "virtual/function" (e.g. "virtual/kernel"). The slash is simply part of the name and has no syntactical significance.

The [`PREFERRED_PROVIDER`][2952] variable is used to select which particular recipe provides a virtual target.

### Note

A corresponding mechanism for virtual runtime dependencies (packages) exists. However, the mechanism does not depend on any special functionality beyond ordinary variable assignments. For example, `VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_dev_manager`refers to the package of the component that manages the `/dev` directory.

Setting the "preferred provider" for runtime dependencies is as simple as using the following assignment in a configuration file:

```
     VIRTUAL-RUNTIME_dev_manager = "udev"

```

```

You must set the variable if you want to automatically start a local [PR service][2956]. You can set `PRSERV_HOST` to other values to use a remote PR service.

The version of the recipe. The version is normally extracted from the recipe filename. For example, if the recipe is named `expat_2.0.1.bb`, then the default value of `PV` will be "2.0.1". `PV` is generally not overridden within a recipe unless it is building an unstable (i.e. development) version from a source code repository (e.g. Git or Subversion).

`PV` is the default value of the [`PKGV`][2961] variable.

When used by recipes that inherit the [`distutils3`][2963], [`setuptools3`][2964], [`distutils`][2965], or [`setuptools`][2966]classes, denotes the Application Binary Interface (ABI) currently in use for Python. By default, the ABI is "m". You do not have to set this variable as the OpenEmbedded build system sets it for you.

The OpenEmbedded build system uses the ABI to construct directory names used when installing the Python headers and libraries in sysroot (e.g. `.../python3.3m/...`).

Recipes that inherit the [`distutils`][2967] class during cross-builds also use this variable to locate the headers and libraries of the appropriate Python that the extension is targeting.

When used by recipes that inherit the [`distutils3`][2969], [`setuptools3`][2970], [`distutils`][2971], or [`setuptools`][2972]classes, specifies the major Python version being built. For Python 2.x, `PYTHON_PN` would be "python2". For Python 3.x, the variable would be "python3". You do not have to set this variable as the OpenEmbedded build system automatically sets it for you.

The variable allows recipes to use common infrastructure such as the following:

```
     DEPENDS += "${PYTHON_PN}-native"

```

In the previous example, the version of the dependency is `PYTHON_PN`.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The list of packages that conflict with packages. Note that packages will not be installed if conflicting packages are not first removed.

Like all package-controlling variables, you must always use them in conjunction with a package name override. Here is an example:

```
     RCONFLICTS_${PN} = "another_conflicting_package_name"

```

BitBake, which the OpenEmbedded build system uses, supports specifying versioned dependencies. Although the syntax varies depending on the packaging format, BitBake hides these differences from you. Here is the general syntax to specify versions with the `RCONFLICTS` variable:

```
     RCONFLICTS_${PN} = "package (operator version)"

```

For `operator`, you can specify the following:

```
     =
     <
     >
     <=
     >=

```

For example, the following sets up a dependency on version 1.2 or greater of the package `foo`:

```
     RCONFLICTS_${PN} = "foo (>= 1.2)"

```
</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">RDEPENDS[¶][2975]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Lists runtime dependencies of a package. These dependencies are other packages that must be installed in order for the package to function correctly. As an example, the following assignment declares that the package `foo` needs the packages `bar` and `baz` to be installed:

```
     RDEPENDS_foo = "bar baz"

```

The most common types of package runtime dependencies are automatically detected and added. Therefore, most recipes do not need to set `RDEPENDS`. For more information, see the "[Automatically Added Runtime Dependencies][2976]" section.

The practical effect of the above `RDEPENDS` assignment is that `bar` and `baz` will be declared as dependencies inside the package `foo` when it is written out by one of the [`do_package_write_*`][2977]tasks. Exactly how this is done depends on which package format is used, which is determined by[`PACKAGE_CLASSES`][2978]. When the corresponding package manager installs the package, it will know to also install the packages on which it depends.

To ensure that the packages `bar` and `baz` get built, the previous `RDEPENDS` assignment also causes a task dependency to be added. This dependency is from the recipe's [`do_build`][2979] (not to be confused with [`do_compile`][2980]) task to the `do_package_write_*` task of the recipes that build `bar` and `baz`.

The names of the packages you list within `RDEPENDS` must be the names of other packages - they cannot be recipe names. Although package names and recipe names usually match, the important point here is that you are providing package names within the `RDEPENDS` variable. For an example of the default list of packages created from a recipe, see the [`PACKAGES`][2981] variable.

Because the `RDEPENDS` variable applies to packages being built, you should always use the variable in a form with an attached package name (remember that a single recipe can build multiple packages). For example, suppose you are building a development package that depends on the `perl` package. In this case, you would use the following `RDEPENDS` statement:

```
     RDEPENDS_${PN}-dev += "perl"

```

In the example, the development package depends on the `perl` package. Thus, the `RDEPENDS`variable has the `${PN}-dev` package name as part of the variable.

### Caution

`RDEPENDS_${PN}-dev` includes `${`[`PN`][2982]`}` by default. This default is set in the BitBake configuration file (`meta/conf/bitbake.conf`). Be careful not to accidentally remove `${PN}` when modifying `RDEPENDS_${PN}-dev`. Use the "+=" operator rather than the "=" operator.

The package names you use with `RDEPENDS` must appear as they would in the `PACKAGES` variable. The [`PKG`][2983] variable allows a different name to be used for the final package (e.g. the [`debian`][2984] class uses this to rename packages), but this final package name cannot be used with `RDEPENDS`, which makes sense as `RDEPENDS` is meant to be independent of the package format used.

BitBake, which the OpenEmbedded build system uses, supports specifying versioned dependencies. Although the syntax varies depending on the packaging format, BitBake hides these differences from you. Here is the general syntax to specify versions with the `RDEPENDS` variable:

```
     RDEPENDS_${PN} = "package (operator version)"

```

For  _`operator`_ , you can specify the following:

```
     =
     <
     >
     <=
     >=

```

For  _`version`_ , provide the version number.

### Tip

You can use [`EXTENDPKGV`][2985] to provide a full package version specification.

For example, the following sets up a dependency on version 1.2 or greater of the package `foo`:

```
     RDEPENDS_${PN} = "foo (>= 1.2)"

```

For information on build-time dependencies, see the [`DEPENDS`][2986] variable. You can also see the "[Tasks][2987]" and "[Dependencies][2988]" sections in the BitBake User Manual for additional information on tasks and dependencies.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When inheriting the [`distro_features_check`][2990] class, this variable identifies distribution features that must exist in the current configuration in order for the OpenEmbedded build system to build the recipe. In other words, if the `REQUIRED_DISTRO_FEATURES` variable lists a feature that does not appear in `DISTRO_FEATURES` within the current configuration, an error occurs and the build stops.

Defines the root home directory. By default, this directory is set as follows in the BitBake configuration file:

```
     ROOT_HOME ??= "/home/root"

```

### Note

This default value is likely used because some embedded solutions prefer to have a read-only root filesystem and prefer to keep writeable data in one place.

You can override the default by setting the variable in any layer or in the `local.conf` file. Because the default is set using a "weak" assignment (i.e. "??="), you can use either of the following forms to define your override:

```
     ROOT_HOME = "/root"
     ROOT_HOME ?= "/root"

```

These override examples use `/root`, which is probably the most commonly used override.

A list of package name aliases that a package also provides. These aliases are useful for satisfying runtime dependencies of other packages both during the build and on the target (as specified by`[RDEPENDS][1524]`).

### Note

A package's own name is implicitly already in its `RPROVIDES` list.

As with all package-controlling variables, you must always use the variable in conjunction with a package name override. Here is an example:

```
     RPROVIDES_${PN} = "widget-abi-2"

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">RRECOMMENDS[¶][3005]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A list of packages that extends the usability of a package being built. The package being built does not depend on this list of packages in order to successfully build, but rather uses them for extended usability. To specify runtime dependencies for packages, see the `[RDEPENDS][1525]` variable.

The package manager will automatically install the `RRECOMMENDS` list of packages when installing the built package. However, you can prevent listed packages from being installed by using the[`BAD_RECOMMENDATIONS`][3006], [`NO_RECOMMENDATIONS`][3007], and [`PACKAGE_EXCLUDE`][3008] variables.

Packages specified in `RRECOMMENDS` need not actually be produced. However, a recipe must exist that provides each package, either through the [`PACKAGES`][3009] or [`PACKAGES_DYNAMIC`][3010] variables or the[`RPROVIDES`][3011] variable, or an error will occur during the build. If such a recipe does exist and the package is not produced, the build continues without error.

Because the `RRECOMMENDS` variable applies to packages being built, you should always attach an override to the variable to specify the particular package whose usability is being extended. For example, suppose you are building a development package that is extended to support wireless functionality. In this case, you would use the following:

```
     RRECOMMENDS_${PN}-dev += "wireless_package_name"

```

In the example, the package name (`${[PN][1526]}-dev`) must appear as it would in the `[PACKAGES][1527]`namespace before any renaming of the output package by classes such as `debian.bbclass`.

BitBake, which the OpenEmbedded build system uses, supports specifying versioned recommends. Although the syntax varies depending on the packaging format, BitBake hides these differences from you. Here is the general syntax to specify versions with the `RRECOMMENDS` variable:

```
     RRECOMMENDS_${PN} = "package (operator version)"

```

For `operator`, you can specify the following:

```
     =
     <
     >
     <=
     >=

```

For example, the following sets up a recommend on version 1.2 or greater of the package `foo`:

```
     RRECOMMENDS_${PN} = "foo (>= 1.2)"

```

A list of packages replaced by a package. The package manager uses this variable to determine which package should be installed to replace other package(s) during an upgrade. In order to also have the other package(s) removed at the same time, you must add the name of the other package to the `[RCONFLICTS][1528]` variable.

As with all package-controlling variables, you must use this variable in conjunction with a package name override. Here is an example:

```
     RREPLACES_${PN} = "other_package_being_replaced"

```

BitBake, which the OpenEmbedded build system uses, supports specifying versioned replacements. Although the syntax varies depending on the packaging format, BitBake hides these differences from you. Here is the general syntax to specify versions with the `RREPLACES` variable:

```
     RREPLACES_${PN} = "package (operator version)"

```

For `operator`, you can specify the following:

```
     =
     <
     >
     <=
     >=

```

For example, the following sets up a replacement using version 1.2 or greater of the package `foo`:

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The location in the [Build Directory][3015] where unpacked recipe source code resides. By default, this directory is `${`[`WORKDIR`][3016]`}/${`[`BPN`][3017]`}-${`[`PV`][3018]`}`, where `${BPN}` is the base recipe name and `${PV}` is the recipe version. If the source tarball extracts the code to a directory named anything other than `${BPN}-${PV}`, or if the source code if fetched from an SCM such as Git or Subversion, then you must set `S` in the recipe so that the OpenEmbedded build system knows where to find the unpacked source.

As an example, assume a [Source Directory][3019] top-level folder named `poky` and a default Build Directory at `poky/build`. In this case, the work directory the build system uses to keep the unpacked recipe for `db` is the following:

```
     poky/build/tmp/work/qemux86-poky-linux/db/5.1.19-r3/db-5.1.19

```

The unpacked source code resides in the `db-5.1.19` folder.

This next example assumes a Git repository. By default, Git repositories are cloned to`${WORKDIR}/git` during [`do_fetch`][3020]. Since this path is different from the default value of `S`, you must set it specifically so the source can be located:

```
     SRC_URI = "git://path/to/repo.git"
     S = "${WORKDIR}/git"

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A list of the host distribution identifiers that the build system has been tested against. Identifiers consist of the host distributor ID followed by the release, as reported by the `lsb_release` tool or as read from `/etc/lsb-release`. Separate the list items with explicit newline characters (`\n`). If `SANITY_TESTED_DISTROS` is not empty and the current value of [`NATIVELSBSTRING`][3023] does not appear in the list, then the build system reports a warning that indicates the current host distribution has not been tested as a build host.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The directory set up and used by the [`populate_sdk_base`][3027] to which the SDK is deployed. The `populate_sdk_base` class defines `SDK_DEPLOY` as follows:

```
     SDK_DEPLOY = "${TMPDIR}/deploy/sdk"

Controls whether or not shared state artifacts are copied into the extensible SDK. The default value of "full" copies all of the required shared state artifacts into the extensible SDK. The value "minimal" leaves these artifacts out of the SDK.

### Note

If you set the variable to "minimal", you need to ensure [`SSTATE_MIRRORS`][3034] is set in the SDK's configuration to enable the artifacts to be fetched as needed.</dd>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The manifest file for the host part of the SDK. This file lists all the installed packages that make up the host part of SDK. The file contains package information on a line-per-package basis as follows:

```
     packagename packagearch version

```

The [`populate_sdk_base`][3036] class defines the manifest file as follows:

```
     SDK_HOST_MANIFEST = "${SDK_DEPLOY}/${TOOLCHAIN_OUTPUTNAME}.host.manifest"

When set to "1", specifies to include the packagedata for all recipes in the "world" target in the extensible SDK. Including this data allows the `devtool search` command to find these recipes in search results, as well as allows the `devtool add` command to map dependencies more effectively.

### Note

Enabling the `SDK_INCLUDE_PKGDATA` variable significantly increases build time because all of world needs to be built. Enabling the variable also slightly increases the size of the extensible SDK.</dd>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When set to "1", specifies to include the toolchain in the extensible SDK. Including the toolchain is useful particularly when [`SDK_EXT_TYPE`][3041] is set to "minimal" to keep the SDK reasonably small but you still want to provide a usable toolchain. For example, suppose you want to use the toolchain from an IDE (e.g. Eclipse) or from other tools and you do not want to perform additional steps to install the toolchain.

The `SDK_INCLUDE_TOOLCHAIN` variable defaults to "0" if `SDK_EXT_TYPE` is set to "minimal", and defaults to "1" if `SDK_EXT_TYPE` is set to "full".

Specifies a list of functions to call once the OpenEmbedded build system has created the SDK. You can specify functions separated by semicolons:

```
     SDK_POSTPROCESS_COMMAND += "function; ... "

```

If you need to pass an SDK path to a command within a function, you can use `${SDK_DIR}`, which points to the parent directory used by the OpenEmbedded build system when creating SDK output. See the [`SDK_DIR`][3061] variable for more information.

```
     do_populate_lic
     do_package_qa
     do_populate_sysroot
     do_deploy

```

Despite the default value of "" for the `SDK_RECRDEP_TASKS` variable, the above four tasks are always added to the SDK. To specify tasks beyond these four, you need to use the `SDK_RECRDEP_TASKS`variable (e.g. you are defining additional tasks that are needed in order to build [`SDK_TARGETS`][3065]).

```
    SIGGEN_EXCLUDE_SAFE_RECIPE_DEPS += "intone->mplayer2"

```

In this example, `intone` depends on `mplayer2`.

Use of this variable is one mechanism to remove dependencies that affect task signatures and thus force rebuilds when a recipe changes.

### Caution

If you add an inappropriate dependency for a recipe relationship, the software might break during runtime if the interface of the second recipe was changed after the first recipe had been built.</dd>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When you are fetching files to create a mirror of sources (i.e. creating a source mirror), setting`SOURCE_MIRROR_FETCH` to "1" in your `local.conf` configuration file ensures the source for all recipes are fetched regardless of whether or not a recipe is compatible with the configuration. A recipe is considered incompatible with the currently configured machine when either or both the[`COMPATIBLE_MACHINE`][3107] variable and [`COMPATIBLE_HOST`][3108] variables specify compatibility with a machine other than that of the current machine or host.

### Warning

Do not set the `SOURCE_MIRROR_FETCH` variable unless you are creating a source mirror. In other words, do not set the variable during a normal build.</dd>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A list of prefixes for [`PN`][3116] used by the OpenEmbedded build system to create variants of recipes or packages. The list specifies the prefixes to strip off during certain circumstances such as the generation of the [`BPN`][3117] variable.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The list of source files - local or remote. This variable tells the OpenEmbedded build system which bits to pull in for the build and how to pull them in. For example, if the recipe or append file only needs to fetch a tarball from the Internet, the recipe or append file uses a single `SRC_URI` entry. On the other hand, if the recipe or append file needs to fetch a tarball, apply two patches, and include a custom file, the recipe or append file would include four instances of the variable.

The following list explains the available URI protocols. URI protocols are highly dependent on particular BitBake Fetcher submodules. Depending on the fetcher BitBake uses, various URL parameters are employed. For specifics on the supported Fetchers, see the "[Fetchers][3119]" section in the BitBake User Manual.

*   _`file://` -_  Fetches files, which are usually files shipped with the [Metadata][86], from the local machine. The path is relative to the [`FILESPATH`][87] variable. Thus, the build system searches, in order, from the following directories, which are assumed to be a subdirectories of the directory in which the recipe file (`.bb`) or append file (`.bbappend`) resides:

    *   _`${BPN}` -_  The base recipe name without any special suffix or version numbers.

    *   _`${BP}` -_  `${[BPN][1]}-${PV}`. The base recipe name and version but without any special package name suffix.

    *   _files -_  Files within a directory, which is named `files` and is also alongside the recipe or append file.

    ### Note

    If you want the build system to pick up files specified through a `SRC_URI`statement from your append file, you need to be sure to extend the `FILESPATH`variable by also using the [`FILESEXTRAPATHS`][88] variable from within your append file.

*   _`bzr://` -_  Fetches files from a Bazaar revision control repository.

*   _`git://` -_  Fetches files from a Git revision control repository.

*   _`osc://` -_  Fetches files from an OSC (OpenSUSE Build service) revision control repository.

*   _`repo://` -_  Fetches files from a repo (Git) repository.

*   _`ccrc://` -_  Fetches files from a ClearCase repository.

*   _`http://` -_  Fetches files from the Internet using `http`.

*   _`https://` -_  Fetches files from the Internet using `https`.

*   _`ftp://` -_  Fetches files from the Internet using `ftp`.

*   _`cvs://` -_  Fetches files from a CVS revision control repository.

*   _`hg://` -_  Fetches files from a Mercurial (`hg`) revision control repository.

*   _`p4://` -_  Fetches files from a Perforce (`p4`) revision control repository.

*   _`ssh://` -_  Fetches files from a secure shell.

*   _`svn://` -_  Fetches files from a Subversion (`svn`) revision control repository.

Standard and recipe-specific options for `SRC_URI` exist. Here are standard options:

*   _`apply` -_  Whether to apply the patch or not. The default action is to apply the patch.

*   _`striplevel` -_  Which striplevel to use when applying the patch. The default level is 1.

*   _`patchdir` -_  Specifies the directory in which the patch should be applied. The default is `${`[`S`][89]`}`.

Here are options specific to recipes building code from a revision control system:

*   _`mindate` -_  Apply the patch only if [`SRCDATE`][90] is equal to or greater than `mindate`.

*   _`maxdate` -_  Apply the patch only if `SRCDATE` is not later than `mindate`.

*   _`minrev` -_  Apply the patch only if `SRCREV` is equal to or greater than `minrev`.

*   _`maxrev` -_  Apply the patch only if `SRCREV` is not later than `maxrev`.

*   _`rev` -_  Apply the patch only if `SRCREV` is equal to `rev`.

*   _`notrev` -_  Apply the patch only if `SRCREV` is not equal to `rev`.

Here are some additional options worth mentioning:

*   _`unpack` -_  Controls whether or not to unpack the file if it is an archive. The default action is to unpack the file.

*   _`destsuffix` -_  Places the file (or extracts its contents) into the specified subdirectory of [`WORKDIR`][91]when the Git fetcher is used.

*   _`subdir` -_  Places the file (or extracts its contents) into the specified subdirectory of [`WORKDIR`][92] when the local (`file://`) fetcher is used.

*   _`localdir` -_  Places the file (or extracts its contents) into the specified subdirectory of [`WORKDIR`][93]when the CVS fetcher is used.

*   _`subpath` -_  Limits the checkout to a specific subpath of the tree when using the Git fetcher is used.

*   _`name` -_  Specifies a name to be used for association with `SRC_URI` checksums when you have more than one file specified in `SRC_URI`.

*   _`downloadfilename` -_  Specifies the filename used when storing the downloaded file.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

By default, the OpenEmbedded build system automatically detects whether `[SRC_URI][1533]` contains files that are machine-specific. If so, the build system automatically changes `[PACKAGE_ARCH][1534]`. Setting this variable to "0" disables this behavior.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Returns the version string of the current package. This string is used to help define the value of [`PV`][3123].

The `SRCPV` variable is defined in the `meta/conf/bitbake.conf` configuration file in the [Source Directory][3124] as follows:

```
     SRCPV = "${@bb.fetch2.get_srcrev(d)}"

```

Recipes that need to define `PV` do so with the help of the `SRCPV`. For example, the `ofono` recipe (`ofono_git.bb`) located in `meta/recipes-connectivity` in the Source Directory defines `PV` as follows:

```
     PV = "0.12-git${SRCPV}"

The revision of the source code used to build the package. This variable applies to Subversion, Git, Mercurial and Bazaar only. Note that if you want to build a fixed revision and you want to avoid performing a query on the remote repository every time BitBake parses your recipe, you should specify a `SRCREV` that is a full revision identifier and not just a tag.

### Note

For information on limitations when inheriting the latest revision of software using`SRCREV`, see the [`AUTOREV`][3126] variable description and the "[Automatically Incrementing a Binary Package Revision Number][3127]" section, which is in the Yocto Project Development Manual.</dd>

Using the`SSTATE_MIRROR_ALLOW_NETWORK` variable is useful if you have set `SSTATE_MIRRORS` to point to an internal server for your shared state cache, but you want to disable any other fetching from the network.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">SSTATE_MIRRORS[¶][3131]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Configures the OpenEmbedded build system to search other mirror locations for prebuilt cache data objects before building out the data. This variable works like fetcher [`MIRRORS`][3132] and [`PREMIRRORS`][3133] and points to the cache locations to check for the shared objects.

You can specify a filesystem directory or a remote URL such as HTTP or FTP. The locations you specify need to contain the shared state cache (sstate-cache) results from previous builds. The sstate-cache you point to can also be from builds on other machines.

If a mirror uses the same structure as [`SSTATE_DIR`][3134], you need to add "PATH" at the end as shown in the examples below. The build system substitutes the correct path within the directory structure.

```
     SSTATE_MIRRORS ?= "\
     file://.* http://someserver.tld/share/sstate/PATH;downloadfilename=PATH \n \
     file://.* file:///some-local-dir/sstate/PATH"

Controls the list of files the OpenEmbedded build system scans for hardcoded installation paths.

During a build, the OpenEmbedded build system creates a shared state (sstate) object during the first stage of preparing the sysroots. During the build, the object is scanned for hardcoded paths for original installation locations. The list of files that are scanned for paths is controlled by the `SSTATE_SCAN_FILES` variable.

### Note

This style of build configuration has been largely replaced by `pkg-config`. Consequently, if `pkg-config` is supported by the library to which you are linking, it is recommended you use `pkg-config` instead of a provided configuration script.</dd>

Specifies the path to the top-level sysroots directory (i.e. `${`[`TMPDIR`][3148]`}/sysroots`).

`STAGING_DIR` contains the directories that are staged into the sysroot by the [`do_populate_sysroot`][3149]task. See the [`SYSROOT_DIRS`][3150] variable and the "[Sharing Files Between Recipes][3151]" section for more information.

### Note

Recipes should never write files directly under the `STAGING_DIR` directory because the OpenEmbedded build system manages the directory automatically. Instead, files should be installed to `${`[`D`][3152]`}` within your recipe's [`do_install`][3153] task and then the OpenEmbedded build system will stage a subset of those files into the sysroot.</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">STAGING_DIR_HOST[¶][3154]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the path to the sysroot directory for the system that the component is built to run on (the system that hosts the component). For most recipes, this sysroot is the one that the recipe's[`do_populate_sysroot`][3155] task copies files into. Exceptions include `-native` recipes, where the `do_populate_sysroot` task instead uses [`STAGING_DIR_NATIVE`][3156]. Depending on the type of recipe and the build target, `STAGING_DIR_HOST` can have the following values:

*   For recipes building for the target machine, the value is "${[STAGING_DIR][94]}/${[MACHINE][95]}".

*   For native recipes building for the build host, the value is empty given the assumption that when building for the build host, the build host's own directories should be used.

    ### Note

    `-native` recipes are not installed into host paths like such as `/usr`. Rather, these recipes are installed into `STAGING_DIR_NATIVE`. When compiling `-native` recipes, standard build environment variables such as [`CPPFLAGS`][4] and[`CFLAGS`][5] are set up so that both host paths and `STAGING_DIR_NATIVE` are searched for libraries and headers using, for example, GCC's `-isystem` option.

    This emphasizes that the `STAGING_DIR*` variables should be viewed as input variables by tasks such as [`do_configure`][6], [`do_compile`][7], and [`do_install`][8]. Having the real system root correspond to `STAGING_DIR_HOST` makes conceptual sense for `-native` recipes, as they make use of host headers and libraries.

Specifies the path to the sysroot used for the system for which the component generates code. For components that do not generate code, which is the majority, `STAGING_DIR_TARGET` is set to match[`STAGING_DIR_HOST`][3159].

Some recipes build binaries that can run on the target system but those binaries in turn generate code for another different system (e.g. cross-canadian recipes). Using terminology from GNU, the primary system is referred to as the "HOST" and the secondary, or different, system is referred to as the "TARGET". Thus, the binaries run on the "HOST" system and generate binaries for the "TARGET" system. The `STAGING_DIR_HOST` variable points to the sysroot used for the "HOST" system, while`STAGING_DIR_TARGET` points to the sysroot used for the "TARGET" system.

This is a specific kernel compiler flag for a CPU or Application Binary Interface (ABI) tune. The flag is used rarely and only for cases where a userspace [`TUNE_CCARGS`][3240] is not compatible with the kernel compilation. The `TARGET_CC_KERNEL_ARCH` variable allows the kernel (and associated modules) to use a different configuration.

Specifies the flags to pass to the linker when building for the target. When building in the target context, [`LDFLAGS`][3255] is set to the value of this variable by default.

Additionally, the SDK's environment setup script sets the [`LDFLAGS`][3256] variable in the environment to the`TARGET_LDFLAGS` value so that executables built using the SDK also have the flags applied.

Specifies the prefix used for the toolchain binary target tools.

Depending on the type of recipe and the build target, `TARGET_PREFIX` is set as follows:

*   For recipes building for the target machine, the value is "${[TARGET_SYS][96]}-".

*   For native recipes, the build system sets the variable to the value of `BUILD_PREFIX`.

*   For native SDK recipes (`nativesdk`), the build system sets the variable to the value of`SDK_PREFIX`.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">TARGET_SYS[¶][3259]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the system, including the architecture and the operating system, for which the build is occurring in the context of the current recipe.

The OpenEmbedded build system automatically sets this variable based on [`TARGET_ARCH`][3260],[`TARGET_VENDOR`][3261], and [`TARGET_OS`][3262] variables.

### Note

You do not need to set the `TARGET_SYS` variable yourself.

Consider these two examples:

*   Given a native recipe on a 32-bit, x86 machine running Linux, the value is "i686-linux".

*   Given a recipe being built for a little-endian, MIPS target running Linux, the value might be "mipsel-linux".

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies a suffix to be appended onto the [`TMPDIR`][3265] value. The suffix identifies the `libc` variant for building. When you are building for multiple variants with the same [Build Directory][3266], this mechanism ensures that output for different `libc` variants is kept separate to avoid potential conflicts.

In the `defaultsetup.conf` file, the default value of `TCLIBCAPPEND` is "-${TCLIBC}". However, distros such as poky, which normally only support one `libc` variant, set `TCLIBCAPPEND` to "" in their distro configuration file resulting in no suffix being applied.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the GNU standard C library (`libc`) variant to use during the build process. This variable replaces `POKYLIBC`, which is no longer supported.

You can select "glibc" or "uclibc".

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">TCMODE[¶][3268]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the toolchain selector. `TCMODE` controls the characteristics of the generated packages and images by telling the OpenEmbedded build system which toolchain profile to use. By default, the OpenEmbedded build system builds its own internal toolchain. The variable's default value is "default", which uses that internal toolchain.

### Note

If `TCMODE` is set to a value other than "default", then it is your responsibility to ensure that the toolchain is compatible with the default toolchain. Using older or newer versions of these components might cause build problems. See the [Release Notes][3269] for the specific components with which the toolchain must be compatible.

The `TCMODE` variable is similar to [`TCLIBC`][3270], which controls the variant of the GNU standard C library (`libc`) used during the build process: `glibc` or `uclibc`.

With additional layers, it is possible to use a pre-compiled external toolchain. One example is the Sourcery G++ Toolchain. The support for this toolchain resides in the separate Mentor Graphics®`meta-sourcery` layer at [http://github.com/MentorEmbedded/meta-sourcery/][3271].

The layer's `README` file contains information on how to use the Sourcery G++ Toolchain as an external toolchain. In summary, you must be sure to add the layer to your `bblayers.conf` file in front of the `meta` layer and then set the `EXTERNAL_TOOLCHAIN` variable in your `local.conf` file to the location in which you installed the toolchain.

The fundamentals used for this example apply to any external toolchain. You can use `meta-sourcery` as a template for adding support for other external toolchains.

Automatically runs the series of automated tests for images when an image is successfully built.

These tests are written in Python making use of the `unittest` module, and the majority of them run commands on the target system over `ssh`. You can set this variable to "1" in your `local.conf` file in the [Build Directory][3276] to have the OpenEmbedded build system automatically run these tests after an image successfully builds:

```
     TEST_IMAGE = "1"

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

For automated hardware testing, specifies the command to use to connect to the serial console of the target machine under test. This command simply needs to connect to the serial console and forward that connection to standard input and output as any normal terminal program does.

For example, to use the Picocom terminal program on serial device `/dev/ttyUSB0` at 115200bps, you would set the variable as follows:

```
     TEST_SERIALCONTROL_CMD = "picocom /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200"

The IP address of the build machine (host machine). This IP address is usually automatically detected. However, if detection fails, this variable needs to be set to the IP address of the build machine (i.e. where the build is taking place).

### Note

The `TEST_SERVER_IP` variable is only used for a small number of tests such as the "dnf" test suite, which needs to download packages from `WORKDIR/oe-rootfs-repo`.</dd>

Specifies the target controller to use when running tests against a test image. The default controller to use is "qemu":

```
     TEST_TARGET = "qemu"

```

A target controller is a class that defines how an image gets deployed on a target and how a target is started. A layer can extend the controllers by adding a module in the layer's `/lib/oeqa/controllers` directory and by inheriting the `BaseTarget` class, which is an abstract class that cannot be used as a value of `TEST_TARGET`.

You can provide the following arguments with `TEST_TARGET`:

*   _"qemu" and "QemuTarget":_  Boots a QEMU image and runs the tests. See the "[Enabling Runtime Tests on QEMU][97]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual for more information.

*   _"simpleremote" and "SimpleRemoteTarget":_  Runs the tests on target hardware that is already up and running. The hardware can be on the network or it can be a device running an image on QEMU. You must also set [`TEST_TARGET_IP`][98] when you use "simpleremote" or "SimpleRemoteTarget".

    ### Note

    This argument is defined in `meta/lib/oeqa/targetcontrol.py`. The small caps names are kept for compatibility reasons.

*   _"GummibootTarget":_  Automatically deploys and runs tests on an EFI-enabled machine that has a master image installed.

    ### Note

    This argument is defined in `meta/lib/oeqa/controllers/masterimage.py`.

For information on running tests on hardware, see the "[Enabling Runtime Tests on Hardware][3290]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The IP address of your hardware under test. The `TEST_TARGET_IP` variable has no effect when[`TEST_TARGET`][3292] is set to "qemu".

When you specify the IP address, you can also include a port. Here is an example:

```
     TEST_TARGET_IP = "192.168.1.4:2201"

```

Specifying a port is useful when SSH is started on a non-standard port or in cases when your hardware under test is behind a firewall or network that is not directly accessible from your host and you need to do port address translation.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

An ordered list of tests (modules) to run against an image when performing automated runtime testing.

The OpenEmbedded build system provides a core set of tests that can be used against images.

### Note

Currently, there is only support for running these tests under QEMU.

Tests include `ping`, `ssh`, `df` among others. You can add your own tests to the list of tests by appending `TEST_SUITES` as follows:

```
     TEST_SUITES_append = " mytest"

```

Alternatively, you can provide the "auto" option to have all applicable tests run against the image.

```
     TEST_SUITES_append = " auto"

```

Using this option causes the build system to automatically run tests that are applicable to the image. Tests that are not applicable are skipped.

The order in which tests are run is important. Tests that depend on another test must appear later in the list than the test on which they depend. For example, if you append the list of tests with two tests (`test_A` and `test_B`) where `test_B` is dependent on `test_A`, then you must order the tests as follows:

```
     TEST_SUITES = " test_A test_B"

```

For more information on testing images, see the "[Performing Automated Runtime Testing][3294]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

This variable is the base directory the OpenEmbedded build system uses for all build output and intermediate files (other than the shared state cache). By default, the `TMPDIR` variable points to `tmp`within the [Build Directory][3298].

If you want to establish this directory in a location other than the default, you can uncomment and edit the following statement in the `conf/local.conf` file in the [Source Directory][3299]:

```
     #TMPDIR = "${TOPDIR}/tmp"

```

An example use for this scenario is to set `TMPDIR` to a local disk, which does not use NFS, while having the Build Directory use NFS.

The filesystem used by `TMPDIR` must have standard filesystem semantics (i.e. mixed-case files are unique, POSIX file locking, and persistent inodes). Due to various issues with NFS and bugs in some implementations, NFS does not meet this minimum requirement. Consequently, `TMPDIR` cannot be on NFS.

This variable lists packages the OpenEmbedded build system uses when building an SDK, which contains a cross-development environment. The packages specified by this variable are part of the toolchain set that runs on the [`SDKMACHINE`][3301], and each package should usually have the prefix`nativesdk-`. For example, consider the following command when building an SDK:

```
     $ bitbake -c populate_sdk imagename

```

In this case, a default list of packages is set in this variable, but you can add additional packages to the list. See the "[Adding Individual Packages to the Standard SDK][3302]" section in the Yocto Project Software Development Kit (SDK) Developer's Guide for more information.

The GNU canonical architecture for a specific architecture (i.e. `arm`, `armeb`, `mips`, `mips64`, and so forth). BitBake uses this value to setup configuration.

`TUNE_ARCH` definitions are specific to a given architecture. The definitions can be a single static definition, or can be dynamically adjusted. You can see details for a given CPU family by looking at the architecture's `README` file. For example, the `meta/conf/machine/include/mips/README` file in the [Source Directory][3320] provides information for `TUNE_ARCH` specific to the `mips` architecture.

`TUNE_ARCH` is tied closely to [`TARGET_ARCH`][3321], which defines the target machine's architecture. The BitBake configuration file (`meta/conf/bitbake.conf`) sets `TARGET_ARCH` as follows:

```
     TARGET_ARCH = "${TUNE_ARCH}"

```

The following list, which is by no means complete since architectures are configurable, shows supported machine architectures:

```
     arm

Specifies a list of options that, if reported by the configure script as being invalid, should not generate a warning during the [`do_configure`][3359] task. Normally, invalid configure options are simply not passed to the configure script (e.g. should be removed from [`EXTRA_OECONF`][3360] or[`PACKAGECONFIG_CONFARGS`][3361]). However, common options, for example, exist that are passed to all configure scripts at a class level that might not be valid for some configure scripts. It follows that no benefit exists in seeing a warning about these options. For these cases, the options are added to`UNKNOWN_CONFIGURE_WHITELIST`.

When using [SysVinit][3376], determines whether or not to run a [getty][3377] on any virtual terminals in order to enable logging in through those terminals.

The default value used for `USE_VT` is "1" when no default value is specifically set. Typically, you would set `USE_VT` to "0" in the machine configuration file for machines that do not have a graphical display attached and therefore do not need virtual terminal functionality.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">USER_CLASSES[¶][3378]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

A list of classes to globally inherit. These classes are used by the OpenEmbedded build system to enable extra features (e.g. `buildstats`, `image-mklibs`, and so forth).

The default list is set in your `local.conf` file:

```
     USER_CLASSES ?= "buildstats image-mklibs image-prelink"

```

For more information, see `meta-poky/conf/local.conf.sample` in the [Source Directory][3379].

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">USERADD_ERROR_DYNAMIC[¶][3380]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

If set to "error", forces the OpenEmbedded build system to produce an error if the user identification (`uid`) and group identification (`gid`) values are not defined in `files/passwd` and `files/group` files. If set to "warn", a warning will be issued instead.

The default behavior for the build system is to dynamically apply `uid` and `gid` values. Consequently, the `USERADD_ERROR_DYNAMIC` variable is by default not set. If you plan on using statically assigned`gid` and `uid` values, you should set the `USERADD_ERROR_DYNAMIC` variable in your `local.conf` file as follows:

```
     USERADD_ERROR_DYNAMIC = "error"

```

Overriding the default behavior implies you are going to also take steps to set static `uid` and `gid`values through use of the [`USERADDEXTENSION`][3381], [`USERADD_UID_TABLES`][3382], and [`USERADD_GID_TABLES`][3383]variables.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">USERADD_GID_TABLES[¶][3384]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies a password file to use for obtaining static group identification (`gid`) values when the OpenEmbedded build system adds a group to the system during package installation.

When applying static group identification (`gid`) values, the OpenEmbedded build system looks in[`BBPATH`][3385] for a `files/group` file and then applies those `uid` values. Set the variable as follows in your`local.conf` file:

```
     USERADD_GID_TABLES = "files/group"

```

### Note

Setting the [`USERADDEXTENSION`][3386] variable to "useradd-staticids" causes the build system to use static `gid` values.</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">USERADD_PACKAGES[¶][3387]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When inheriting the [`useradd`][3388] class, this variable specifies the individual packages within the recipe that require users and/or groups to be added.

You must set this variable if the recipe inherits the class. For example, the following enables adding a user for the main package in a recipe:

```
     USERADD_PACKAGES = "${PN}"

```

### Note

If follows that if you are going to use the `USERADD_PACKAGES` variable, you need to set one or more of the [`USERADD_PARAM`][3389], [`GROUPADD_PARAM`][3390], or [`GROUPMEMS_PARAM`][3391]variables.</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">USERADD_PARAM[¶][3392]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When inheriting the [`useradd`][3393] class, this variable specifies for a package what parameters should be passed to the `useradd` command if you wish to add a user to the system when the package is installed.

Here is an example from the `dbus` recipe:

```
     USERADD_PARAM_${PN} = "--system --home ${localstatedir}/lib/dbus \
                            --no-create-home --shell /bin/false \
                            --user-group messagebus"

```

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">USERADD_UID_TABLES[¶][3395]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies a password file to use for obtaining static user identification (`uid`) values when the OpenEmbedded build system adds a user to the system during package installation.

When applying static user identification (`uid`) values, the OpenEmbedded build system looks in[`BBPATH`][3396] for a `files/passwd` file and then applies those `uid` values. Set the variable as follows in your`local.conf` file:

```
     USERADD_UID_TABLES = "files/passwd"

```

### Note

Setting the [`USERADDEXTENSION`][3397] variable to "useradd-staticids" causes the build system to use static `uid` values.</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">USERADDEXTENSION[¶][3398]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When set to "useradd-staticids", causes the OpenEmbedded build system to base all user and group additions on a static `passwd` and `group` files found in [`BBPATH`][3399].

To use static user identification (`uid`) and group identification (`gid`) values, set the variable as follows in your `local.conf` file:

```
     USERADDEXTENSION = "useradd-staticids"

```

### Note

Setting this variable to use static `uid` and `gid` values causes the OpenEmbedded build system to employ the [`useradd-staticids`][3400] class.

If you use static `uid` and `gid` information, you must also specify the `files/passwd` and `files/group`files by setting the [`USERADD_UID_TABLES`][3401] and [`USERADD_GID_TABLES`][3402] variables. Additionally, you should also set the [`USERADD_ERROR_DYNAMIC`][3403] variable.

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">VOLATILE_LOG_DIR[¶][3404]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the persistence of the target's `/var/log` directory, which is used to house postinstall target log files.

By default, `VOLATILE_LOG_DIR` is set to "yes", which means the file is not persistent. You can override this setting by setting the variable to "no" to make the log directory persistent.

</dd>

</dl>

### W

<dl style="padding-top: 0em;">

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">WARN_QA[¶][3405]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the quality assurance checks whose failures are reported as warnings by the OpenEmbedded build system. You set this variable in your distribution configuration file. For a list of the checks you can control with this variable, see the "[`insane.bbclass`][3406]" section.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">WKS_FILE_DEPENDS[¶][3407]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

When placed in the recipe that builds your image, this variable lists build-time dependencies. The `WKS_FILE_DEPENDS` variable is only applicable when Wic images are active (i.e. when [`IMAGE_FSTYPES`][3408]contains entries related to Wic). If your recipe does not create Wic images, the variable has no effect.

The `WKS_FILE_DEPENDS` variable is similar to the [`DEPENDS`][3409] variable. When you use the variable in your recipe that builds the Wic image, dependencies you list in the `WIC_FILE_DEPENDS` variable are added to the `DEPENDS` variable.

With the `WKS_FILE_DEPENDS` variable, you have the possibility to specify a list of additional dependencies (e.g. native tools, bootloaders, and so forth), that are required to build Wic images. Following is an example:

```
     WKS_FILE_DEPENDS = "some-native-tool"

```

In the previous example,  _`some-native-tool`_  would be replaced with an actual native tool on which the build would depend.

</dd>

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">WKS_FILE[¶][3410]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the location of the Wic kickstart file that is used by the OpenEmbedded build system to create a partitioned image ( _`image`_ `.wic`). For information on how to create a partitioned image, see the "[Creating Partitioned Images][3411]" section. For details on the kickstart file format, see the "[OpenEmbedded Kickstart (`.wks`) Reference][3412].

<dt style="font-weight: normal; width: 20em; text-align: right; color: rgb(0, 68, 68);">WORKDIR[¶][3413]</dt>

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

The pathname of the work directory in which the OpenEmbedded build system builds a recipe. This directory is located within the [`TMPDIR`][3414] directory structure and is specific to the recipe being built and the system for which it is being built.

The `WORKDIR` directory is defined as follows:

```
     ${TMPDIR}/work/${MULTIMACH_TARGET_SYS}/${PN}/${EXTENDPE}${PV}-${PR}

```

The actual directory depends on several things:

*   [`TMPDIR`][696]: The top-level build output directory

*   [`MULTIMACH_TARGET_SYS`][697]: The target system identifier

*   [`PN`][698]: The recipe name

*   [`EXTENDPE`][699]: The epoch - (if [`PE`][700] is not specified, which is usually the case for most recipes, then `EXTENDPE` is blank)

*   [`PV`][701]: The recipe version

*   [`PR`][702]: The recipe revision

As an example, assume a Source Directory top-level folder name `poky`, a default Build Directory at`poky/build`, and a `qemux86-poky-linux` machine target system. Furthermore, suppose your recipe is named `foo_1.3.0-r0.bb`. In this case, the work directory the build system uses to build the package would be as follows:

```
     poky/build/tmp/work/qemux86-poky-linux/foo/1.3.0-r0

```

<dd style="margin-top: 0em; margin-left: 25.5em;">

Specifies the packages that should be installed to provide an X server and drivers for the current machine, assuming your image directly includes `packagegroup-core-x11-xserver` or, perhaps indirectly, includes "x11-base" in [`IMAGE_FEATURES`][3416].

The default value of `XSERVER`, if not specified in the machine configuration, is "xserver-xorg xf86-video-fbdev xf86-input-evdev".

**16.1.**

 | 

How does Poky differ from [OpenEmbedded][1544]?

 |
|  | 

The term "[Poky][1545]" refers to the specific reference build system that the Yocto Project provides. Poky is based on [OE-Core][1546] and [BitBake][1547]. Thus, the generic term used here for the build system is the "OpenEmbedded build system." Development in the Yocto Project using Poky is closely tied to OpenEmbedded, with changes always being merged to OE-Core or BitBake first before being pulled back into Poky. This practice benefits both projects immediately.

 |
| 

**16.2.**

 | 

My development system does not meet the required Git, tar, and Python versions. In particular, I do not have Python 3.4.0 or greater. Can I still use the Yocto Project?

 |
|  | 

You can get the required tools on your host development system a couple different ways (i.e. building a tarball or downloading a tarball). See the "[Required Git, tar, and Python Versions][1548]" section for steps on how to update your build tools.

 |
| 

**16.3.**

 | 

How can you claim Poky / OpenEmbedded-Core is stable?

 |
|  | 

There are three areas that help with stability;

*   The Yocto Project team keeps [OE-Core][9] small and focused, containing around 830 recipes as opposed to the thousands available in other OpenEmbedded community layers. Keeping it small makes it easy to test and maintain.

*   The Yocto Project team runs manual and automated tests using a small, fixed set of reference hardware as well as emulated targets.

*   The Yocto Project uses an autobuilder, which provides continuous build and integration tests.

 |
| 

**16.4.**

 | 

How do I get support for my board added to the Yocto Project?

 |
|  | 

Support for an additional board is added by creating a Board Support Package (BSP) layer for it. For more information on how to create a BSP layer, see the "[Understanding and Creating Layers][1549]" section in the Yocto Project Development Manual and the [Yocto Project Board Support Package (BSP) Developer's Guide][1550].

Usually, if the board is not completely exotic, adding support in the Yocto Project is fairly straightforward.

 |
| 

**16.5.**

 | 

Are there any products built using the OpenEmbedded build system?

 |
|  | 

The software running on the [Vernier LabQuest][1551] is built using the OpenEmbedded build system. See the [Vernier LabQuest][1552] website for more information. There are a number of pre-production devices using the OpenEmbedded build system and the Yocto Project team announces them as soon as they are released.

 |
| 

**16.6.**

 | 

What does the OpenEmbedded build system produce as output?

 |
|  | 

Because you can use the same set of recipes to create output of various formats, the output of an OpenEmbedded build depends on how you start it. Usually, the output is a flashable image ready for the target device.

 |
| 

**16.7.**

 | 

How do I add my package to the Yocto Project?

 |
|  | 

To add a package, you need to create a BitBake recipe. For information on how to create a BitBake recipe, see the "[Writing a New Recipe][1553]" in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

 |
| 

**16.8.**

 | 

Do I have to reflash my entire board with a new Yocto Project image when recompiling a package?

 |
|  | 

The OpenEmbedded build system can build packages in various formats such as IPK for OPKG, Debian package (`.deb`), or RPM. You can then upgrade the packages using the package tools on the device, much like on a desktop distribution such as Ubuntu or Fedora. However, package management on the target is entirely optional.

 |
| 

**16.9.**

 | 

I see the error '`chmod: XXXXX new permissions are r-xrwxrwx, not r-xr-xr-x`'. What is wrong?

 |
|  | 

You are probably running the build on an NTFS filesystem. Use `ext2`, `ext3`, or `ext4` instead.

 |
| 

**16.10.**

 | 

I see lots of 404 responses for files on `http://www.yoctoproject.org/sources/*`. Is something wrong?

 |
|  | 

Nothing is wrong. The OpenEmbedded build system checks any configured source mirrors before downloading from the upstream sources. The build system does this searching for both source archives and pre-checked out versions of SCM-managed software. These checks help in large installations because it can reduce load on the SCM servers themselves. The address above is one of the default mirrors configured into the build system. Consequently, if an upstream source disappears, the team can place sources there so builds continue to work.

 |
| 

**16.11.**

 | 

I have machine-specific data in a package for one machine only but the package is being marked as machine-specific in all cases, how do I prevent this?

 |
|  | 

Set `[SRC_URI_OVERRIDES_PACKAGE_ARCH][754] `= "0" in the `.bb` file but make sure the package is manually marked as machine-specific for the case that needs it. The code that handles `SRC_URI_OVERRIDES_PACKAGE_ARCH` is in the `meta/classes/base.bbclass` file.

 |
| 

**16.12.**

 | 

I'm behind a firewall and need to use a proxy server. How do I do that?

 |
|  | 

Most source fetching by the OpenEmbedded build system is done by `wget` and you therefore need to specify the proxy settings in a `.wgetrc`file, which can be in your home directory if you are a single user or can be in `/usr/local/etc/wgetrc` as a global user file.

Following is the applicable code for setting various proxy types in the `.wgetrc` file. By default, these settings are disabled with comments. To use them, remove the comments:

```
     # You can set the default proxies for Wget to use for http, https, and ftp.
     # They will override the value in the environment.
     #https_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
     #http_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/
     #ftp_proxy = http://proxy.yoyodyne.com:18023/

     # If you do not want to use proxy at all, set this to off.
     #use_proxy = on

```

The Yocto Project also includes a `meta-poky/conf/site.conf.sample` file that shows how to configure CVS and Git proxy servers if needed. For more information on setting up various proxy types and configuring proxy servers, see the "[Working Behind a Network Proxy][1554]" Wiki page.

What’s the difference between  _`target`_  and  _`target`_ `-native`?

 |
|  | 

The `*-native` targets are designed to run on the system being used for the build. These are usually tools that are needed to assist the build in some way such as `quilt-native`, which is used to apply patches. The non-native version is the one that runs on the target device.

 |
| 

**16.14.**

 | 

I'm seeing random build failures. Help?!

 |
|  | 

If the same build is failing in totally different and random ways, the most likely explanation is:

*   The hardware you are running the build on has some problem.

*   You are running the build under virtualization, in which case the virtualization probably has bugs.

The OpenEmbedded build system processes a massive amount of data that causes lots of network, disk and CPU activity and is sensitive to even single-bit failures in any of these areas. True random failures have always been traced back to hardware or virtualization issues.

 |
| 

**16.15.**

 | 

When I try to build a native recipe, the build fails with `iconv.h` problems.

 |
|  | 

If you get an error message that indicates GNU `libiconv` is not in use but `iconv.h` has been included from `libiconv`, you need to check to see if you have a previously installed version of the header file in `/usr/local/include`.

```
     #error GNU libiconv not in use but included iconv.h is from libiconv

```

If you find a previously installed file, you should either uninstall it or temporarily rename it and try the build again.

This issue is just a single manifestation of "system leakage" issues caused when the OpenEmbedded build system finds and uses previously installed files during a native build. This type of issue might not be limited to `iconv.h`. Be sure that leakage cannot occur from`/usr/local/include` and `/opt` locations.

| 

**16.16.**

 | 

What do we need to ship for license compliance?

 |
|  | 

This is a difficult question and you need to consult your lawyer for the answer for your specific case. It is worth bearing in mind that for GPL compliance, there needs to be enough information shipped to allow someone else to rebuild and produce the same end result you are shipping. This means sharing the source code, any patches applied to it, and also any configuration information about how that package was configured and built.

You can find more information on licensing in the "[Licensing][1555]" and "[Maintaining Open Source License Compliance During Your Product's Lifecycle][1556]" sections, both of which are in the Yocto Project Development Manual.

**16.17.**

 | 

How do I disable the cursor on my touchscreen device?

 |
|  | 

You need to create a form factor file as described in the "[Miscellaneous BSP-Specific Recipe Files][1557]" section in the Yocto Project Board Support Packages (BSP) Developer's Guide. Set the `HAVE_TOUCHSCREEN` variable equal to one as follows:

```
     HAVE_TOUCHSCREEN=1

```
 |
| 

**16.18.**

 | 

How do I make sure connected network interfaces are brought up by default?

 |
|  | 

The default interfaces file provided by the netbase recipe does not automatically bring up network interfaces. Therefore, you will need to add a BSP-specific netbase that includes an interfaces file. See the "[Miscellaneous BSP-Specific Recipe Files][1558]" section in the Yocto Project Board Support Packages (BSP) Developer's Guide for information on creating these types of miscellaneous recipe files.

For example, add the following files to your layer:

```
     meta-MACHINE/recipes-bsp/netbase/netbase/MACHINE/interfaces
     meta-MACHINE/recipes-bsp/netbase/netbase_5.0.bbappend

```
 |
| 

**16.19.**

 | 

How do I create images with more free space?

 |
|  | 

By default, the OpenEmbedded build system creates images that are 1.3 times the size of the populated root filesystem. To affect the image size, you need to set various configurations:

*   _Image Size:_  The OpenEmbedded build system uses the [`IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE`][10] variable to define the size of the image in Kbytes. The build system determines the size by taking into account the initial root filesystem size before any modifications such as requested size for the image and any requested additional free disk space to be added to the image.

*   _Overhead:_  Use the [`IMAGE_OVERHEAD_FACTOR`][11] variable to define the multiplier that the build system applies to the initial image size, which is 1.3 by default.

*   _Additional Free Space:_  Use the [`IMAGE_ROOTFS_EXTRA_SPACE`][12] variable to add additional free space to the image. The build system adds this space to the image after it determines its `IMAGE_ROOTFS_SIZE`.

 |
| 

**16.20.**

 | 

Why don't you support directories with spaces in the pathnames?

 |
|  | 

The Yocto Project team has tried to do this before but too many of the tools the OpenEmbedded build system depends on, such as `autoconf`, break when they find spaces in pathnames. Until that situation changes, the team will not support spaces in pathnames.

 |
| 

**16.21.**

 | 

How do I use an external toolchain?

 |
|  | 

The toolchain configuration is very flexible and customizable. It is primarily controlled with the `[TCMODE][755]` variable. This variable controls which `tcmode-*.inc` file to include from the `meta/conf/distro/include` directory within the [Source Directory][1559].

The default value of `TCMODE` is "default", which tells the OpenEmbedded build system to use its internally built toolchain (i.e. `tcmode-default.inc`). However, other patterns are accepted. In particular, "external-*" refers to external toolchains. One example is the Sourcery G++ Toolchain. The support for this toolchain resides in the separate `meta-sourcery` layer at [http://github.com/MentorEmbedded/meta-sourcery/][1560].

In addition to the toolchain configuration, you also need a corresponding toolchain recipe file. This recipe file needs to package up any pre-built objects in the toolchain such as `libgcc`, `libstdcc++`, any locales, and `libc`.

 |
| 

**16.22.**

 | 

How does the OpenEmbedded build system obtain source code and will it work behind my firewall or proxy server?

 |
|  | 

The way the build system obtains source code is highly configurable. You can setup the build system to get source code in most environments if HTTP transport is available.

When the build system searches for source code, it first tries the local download directory. If that location fails, Poky tries [`PREMIRRORS`][1561], the upstream source, and then [`MIRRORS`][1562] in that order.

Assuming your distribution is "poky", the OpenEmbedded build system uses the Yocto Project source `PREMIRRORS` by default for SCM-based sources, upstreams for normal tarballs, and then falls back to a number of other mirrors including the Yocto Project source mirror if those fail.

As an example, you could add a specific server for the build system to attempt before any others by adding something like the following to the `local.conf` configuration file:

```
     PREMIRRORS_prepend = "\
     git://.*/.* http://www.yoctoproject.org/sources/ \n \
     ftp://.*/.* http://www.yoctoproject.org/sources/ \n \
     http://.*/.* http://www.yoctoproject.org/sources/ \n \
     https://.*/.* http://www.yoctoproject.org/sources/ \n"

```

These changes cause the build system to intercept Git, FTP, HTTP, and HTTPS requests and direct them to the `http://` sources mirror. You can use `file://` URLs to point to local directories or network shares as well.

Aside from the previous technique, these options also exist:

```
     BB_NO_NETWORK = "1"

```

This statement tells BitBake to issue an error instead of trying to access the Internet. This technique is useful if you want to ensure code builds only from local sources.

Here is another technique:

```
     BB_FETCH_PREMIRRORONLY = "1"

```

This statement limits the build system to pulling source from the `PREMIRRORS` only. Again, this technique is useful for reproducing builds.

Here is another technique:

```
     BB_GENERATE_MIRROR_TARBALLS = "1"

```

This statement tells the build system to generate mirror tarballs. This technique is useful if you want to create a mirror server. If not, however, the technique can simply waste time during the build.

Finally, consider an example where you are behind an HTTP-only firewall. You could make the following changes to the `local.conf`configuration file as long as the `PREMIRRORS` server is current:

```
     PREMIRRORS_prepend = "\
     ftp://.*/.* http://www.yoctoproject.org/sources/ \n \
     http://.*/.* http://www.yoctoproject.org/sources/ \n \
     https://.*/.* http://www.yoctoproject.org/sources/ \n"
     BB_FETCH_PREMIRRORONLY = "1"

```

These changes would cause the build system to successfully fetch source over HTTP and any network accesses to anything other than the `PREMIRRORS` would fail.

The build system also honors the standard shell environment variables `http_proxy`, `ftp_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `all_proxy` to redirect requests through proxy servers.

### Note

**16.23.**

 | 

Can I get rid of build output so I can start over?

 |
|  | 

Yes - you can easily do this. When you use BitBake to build an image, all the build output goes into the directory created when you run the build environment setup script (i.e. [`oe-init-build-env`][1564] or [`oe-init-build-env-memres`][1565]). By default, this [Build Directory][1566] is named `build` but can be named anything you want.

Within the Build Directory, is the `tmp` directory. To remove all the build output yet preserve any source code or downloaded files from previous builds, simply remove the `tmp` directory.

 |
| 

**16.24.**

 | 

Why do `${bindir}` and `${libdir}` have strange values for `-native` recipes?

 |
|  | 

Executables and libraries might need to be used from a directory other than the directory into which they were initially installed. Complicating this situation is the fact that sometimes these executables and libraries are compiled with the expectation of being run from that initial installation target directory. If this is the case, moving them causes problems.

This scenario is a fundamental problem for package maintainers of mainstream Linux distributions as well as for the OpenEmbedded build system. As such, a well-established solution exists. Makefiles, Autotools configuration scripts, and other build systems are expected to respect environment variables such as `bindir`, `libdir`, and `sysconfdir` that indicate where executables, libraries, and data reside when a program is actually run. They are also expected to respect a `DESTDIR` environment variable, which is prepended to all the other variables when the build system actually installs the files. It is understood that the program does not actually run from within `DESTDIR`.

When the OpenEmbedded build system uses a recipe to build a target-architecture program (i.e. one that is intended for inclusion on the image being built), that program eventually runs from the root file system of that image. Thus, the build system provides a value of "/usr/bin" for `bindir`, a value of "/usr/lib" for `libdir`, and so forth.

Meanwhile, `DESTDIR` is a path within the [Build Directory][1567]. However, when the recipe builds a native program (i.e. one that is intended to run on the build machine), that program is never installed directly to the build machine's root file system. Consequently, the build system uses paths within the Build Directory for `DESTDIR`, `bindir` and related variables. To better understand this, consider the following two paths where the first is relatively normal and the second is not:

### Note

Due to these lengthy examples, the paths are artificially broken across lines for readability.
```
     /home/maxtothemax/poky-bootchart2/build/tmp/work/i586-poky-linux/zlib/
        1.2.8-r0/sysroot-destdir/usr/bin

     /home/maxtothemax/poky-bootchart2/build/tmp/work/x86_64-linux/
        zlib-native/1.2.8-r0/sysroot-destdir/home/maxtothemax/poky-bootchart2/
        build/tmp/sysroots/x86_64-linux/usr/bin

```

Even if the paths look unusual, they both are correct - the first for a target and the second for a native recipe. These paths are a consequence of the `DESTDIR` mechanism and while they appear strange, they are correct and in practice very effective.

 |
| 

**16.25.**

 | 

The files provided by my `*-native` recipe do not appear to be available to other recipes. Files are missing from the native sysroot, my recipe is installing to the wrong place, or I am getting permissions errors during the do_install task in my recipe! What is wrong?

 |
|  | 

This situation results when a build system does not recognize the environment variables supplied to it by [BitBake][1568]. The incident that prompted this FAQ entry involved a Makefile that used an environment variable named `BINDIR` instead of the more standard variable `bindir`. The makefile's hardcoded default value of "/usr/bin" worked most of the time, but not for the recipe's `-native` variant. For another example, permissions errors might be caused by a Makefile that ignores `DESTDIR` or uses a different name for that environment variable. Check the the build system to see if these kinds of issues exist.
